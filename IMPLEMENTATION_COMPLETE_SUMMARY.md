- **Key Features**:
  - Automated checks every 30 seconds
  - Individual service monitoring:
    - Database (Supabase)
    - Redis (with fallback detection)
    - Ollama (model availability)
    - LFM2 (circuit breaker status)
    - Circuit breakers (global status)
    - Memory usage
  - REST endpoints for health status
  - Force health check capability
  - Service-specific health queries

## Technical Achievements

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Implementation**: Complete with CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF_OPEN states
- **Features**:
  - Configurable failure thresholds
  - Automatic recovery testing
  - Fallback execution support
  - Detailed metrics and reporting
  - Global registry for monitoring

### Health Monitoring System
- **Architecture**: Service-based with automated scheduling
- **Monitoring Coverage**:
  - All external services
  - Internal system health
  - Memory and resource usage
  - Circuit breaker states
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/monitoring/health/automated` - Current health status
  - `POST /api/v1/monitoring/health/check-all` - Force health check
  - `GET /api/v1/monitoring/health/service/:name` - Individual service health
  - `GET /api/v1/monitoring/circuit-breakers` - Circuit breaker status

### Production Readiness
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive deployment guide
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and metrics
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- **Scalability**: Support for clustering and load balancing
- **Security**: Authentication, CORS, and security headers configured

## System Architecture Improvements

### Before
- Basic error handling
- No automated health checks
- Limited monitoring capabilities
- Synchronous route loading issues

### After
- Enterprise-grade circuit breaker pattern
- Automated health monitoring every 30 seconds
- Comprehensive metrics and diagnostics
- Asynchronous route loading with proper timing
- Graceful degradation for all services
- Production-ready deployment configurations

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test health monitoring (server must be running)
node test-health-monitor.js

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/monitoring/health/automated

# Force health check
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/monitoring/health/check-all

# View circuit breakers
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/monitoring/circuit-breakers
```
