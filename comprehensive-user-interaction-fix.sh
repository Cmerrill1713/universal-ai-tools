echo "üîß COMPREHENSIVE USER INTERACTION FIX"
echo "===================================="
echo

echo "‚úÖ PROBLEM ANALYSIS:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Button interaction works (confirms .allowsHitTesting works)"
echo "‚Ä¢ TextField input still not working"
echo "‚Ä¢ Need to ensure ALL parent views allow user interaction"
echo "‚Ä¢ Must explicitly disable any disabled states"
echo

echo "üîß COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION:"
echo "=========================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Added .allowsHitTesting(true) to EVERY view"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added .disabled(false) to TextField and buttons"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added window key notification handling"
echo "‚Ä¢ Multiple focus attempts with delays"
echo "‚Ä¢ Explicit user interaction at every level"
echo

echo "‚úÖ KEY IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ TextField: .allowsHitTesting(true) + .disabled(false)"
echo "‚Ä¢ All text views: .allowsHitTesting(true)"
echo "‚Ä¢ All buttons: .allowsHitTesting(true) + .disabled(false)"
echo "‚Ä¢ All containers: .allowsHitTesting(true)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Window key notification handling"
echo "‚Ä¢ Multiple delayed focus attempts"
echo

echo "üöÄ TEST THIS VERSION:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. Run from Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "2. Click in the TextField"
echo "3. Try typing"
echo "4. Check console for focus logs"
echo "5. Test the buttons to confirm they still work"
echo

echo "üîç EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ TextField should accept keyboard input"
echo "‚Ä¢ No beeping sounds when typing"
echo "‚Ä¢ Text should appear in real-time"
echo "‚Ä¢ Focus management should work"
echo "‚Ä¢ Buttons should continue to work"
echo

echo "üí° WHY THIS SHOULD WORK:"
echo "========================"
echo "‚Ä¢ Every single view has explicit user interaction enabled"
echo "‚Ä¢ No views are disabled"
echo "‚Ä¢ Window key handling ensures proper focus"
echo "‚Ä¢ Multiple focus attempts catch any timing issues"
echo "‚Ä¢ Comprehensive coverage of all interaction points"
echo

echo "üéØ This is the most thorough user interaction fix possible!"
