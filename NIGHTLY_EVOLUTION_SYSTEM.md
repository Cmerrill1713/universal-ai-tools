## 🧬 How It Self-Evolves

### Autonomous Actions (No Human Needed!)

**1. Keyword Optimization**
```
IF keyword success rate < 50%:
  → AUTOMATICALLY remove from classifier
  → Log: "Removed 'what is' - low success (42%)"
  → Result: Better classification accuracy

IF keyword success rate > 80%:
  → AUTOMATICALLY increase weight
  → Log: "Boosted 'function' - high success (95%)"
  → Result: Better pattern matching
```

**2. Route Strengthening**
```
IF route success rate > 90%:
  → AUTOMATICALLY increase routing confidence
  → Log: "Strengthened general → ai_assistant (100% success)"
  → Result: Faster routing, more confident

IF route success rate < 60%:
  → AUTOMATICALLY decrease priority
  → Log: "Deprioritized research → evolutionary (55% success)"
  → Result: Better backend selection
```

**3. Backend Optimization**
```
IF backend avg_latency < 1.0s:
  → AUTOMATICALLY prioritize for time-sensitive tasks
  → Log: "Prioritized ai_assistant (0.8s avg)"

IF backend avg_latency > 3.0s:
  → AUTOMATICALLY use only when necessary
  → Log: "Deprioritized slow_backend (4.2s avg)"
```

**4. Learning from 48K Documents**
```
Nightly:
  → Analyze query patterns in 48K docs
  → Find which docs are most useful
  → Boost rankings for helpful docs
  → Discover new keyword patterns
  → Identify document relationships
  → Optimize retrieval strategies
```

## 🎯 Integration with Existing Systems

### Coordinated with LLM Grading
```
Your existing LLM grading process:
  → Analyzes response quality
  → Scores outputs
  → Identifies issues

Now runs TOGETHER with evolution:
  → Evolution uses grading scores
  → Poor grades trigger keyword review
  → High grades strengthen routes
  → Automatic improvement loop!
```

### Coordinated with TRM Fine-Tuning
```
Your existing TRM fine-tuning:
  → Collects structured tasks
  → Prepares training data
  → Fine-tunes model

Now runs TOGETHER with evolution:
  → Evolution identifies good examples
  → Fine-tuning uses evolved data
  → TRM learns from evolved patterns
  → Accuracy improves together!
```

## ✅ Benefits of Nightly Schedule

### vs. Real-Time (30 seconds)
```
Real-Time (30s):
  ❌ Too frequent
  ❌ Not enough data per cycle
  ❌ Constant system churn
  ❌ Hard to validate improvements

Nightly (2 AM):
  ✅ Collects full day of data
  ✅ Meaningful pattern detection
  ✅ Stable between evolutions
  ✅ Easy to validate improvements
  ✅ Coordinates with other nightly tasks
```

### Coordination Benefits
```
Nightly at 2 AM:
  ✓ LLM grading runs
  ✓ TRM fine-tuning runs
  ✓ Evolution applies
  ✓ All improve together
  ✓ System wakes up better!
```
