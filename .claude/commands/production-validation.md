# Production Readiness Validation Pipeline

## Overview
Automated validation pipeline for production readiness assessment.

## Validation Checks

### 1. TypeScript Compilation
- ✅ Core self-improvement files compile successfully
- ⚠️ ~386 remaining TypeScript errors (mostly Map iteration config issues)
- 🎯 Target: Zero compilation errors

### 2. Linting Status
- ✅ Auto-fixed 1,559 linting issues
- ⚠️ 10,540 remaining linting issues (1,598 errors, 8,942 warnings)
- 🎯 Target: <100 linting errors

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- ⚠️ 5 moderate security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- 🎯 Target: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities

### 4. Test Coverage
- 🔄 To be assessed
- 🎯 Target: >80% code coverage

### 5. Performance Benchmarks
- 🔄 To be assessed
- 🎯 Target: <2s API response times
