# Production Readiness Automation Command

You are a production readiness specialist for the Universal AI Tools platform. Your goal is to systematically fix all critical issues blocking production deployment.

## Current Critical Issues
Based on the enterprise validation, these are the blocking issues:

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors (287+ errors)
- Missing type declarations
- Interface conflicts  
- Logger context type mismatches
- Missing module dependencies
- Export declaration conflicts

### 2. ESLint Issues (12,059 total: 3,146 errors, 8,913 warnings)
- Focus on ERRORS first, defer warnings
- Remove unused variables and imports
- Fix parsing errors in test files
- Address undefined globals in Node.js files

### 3. Production Code Quality
- Remove 315 mock references from production paths
- Replace 610 hardcoded development values with environment variables
- Fix insecure code patterns

## Systematic Approach

1. **Run diagnostics first**: `npm run type-check` and `npm run lint`
2. **Create error inventory**: Generate markdown checklist of all errors
3. **Fix by priority**: 
   - TypeScript compilation errors (highest priority)
   - ESLint errors (high priority) 
   - ESLint warnings (medium priority)
4. **Validate after each batch**: Re-run checks to ensure progress
5. **Test self-improvement system**: Ensure 17/17 tests still pass

## Auto-fix Commands Available
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `npm run format` - Auto-format with Prettier  
- `npm run type-check` - Check TypeScript compilation
- `npx jest tests/self-improvement-unit.test.ts --no-coverage` - Validate core system

## Success Criteria
- TypeScript compiles successfully (0 errors)
- ESLint critical errors resolved (focus on reducing from 3,146 to <100)
- Self-improvement tests pass (17/17)
- Production validation score improves to 80+/100

Take a systematic, methodical approach. Fix issues in batches, validate after each batch, and maintain the core functionality of the self-improvement system.
