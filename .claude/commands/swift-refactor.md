# Refactor SwiftUI View

Refactor the view at $ARGUMENTS to improve performance and maintainability:

1. Identify complex view bodies causing "compiler unable to type-check" errors
2. Extract complex expressions into computed properties with @ViewBuilder
3. Create reusable subviews for repeated UI patterns
4. Move business logic to ViewModels using @Observable
5. Optimize state management:
   - Use @State only for local UI state
   - Move shared state to @EnvironmentObject
   - Implement proper state initialization
6. Add proper view modifiers for performance:
   - Use .id() for list optimization
   - Implement .equatable() where appropriate
   - Add .drawingGroup() for complex graphics
7. Ensure all animations use .animation(_:value:) for explicit control
8. Verify the refactored view maintains the same functionality
