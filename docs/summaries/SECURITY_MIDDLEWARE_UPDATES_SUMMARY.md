# Security Middleware Updates Summary

## Overview

Successfully updated the CORS and Content Security Policy headers for production readiness in the Universal AI Tools platform. The security middleware now provides environment-aware configuration that enforces strict security policies in production while maintaining development flexibility.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. CORS Configuration Updates

#### Production CORS
- **Removed localhost from production whitelist**: Production now only allows explicitly configured origins
- **Environment-aware origin validation**: Development mode allows localhost variations, production requires explicit configuration
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed logging for CORS decisions with origin and environment context
- **Strict origin validation**: Production mode rejects requests with no origin header

#### Configuration Location
- Updated in: `/src/middleware/security.ts`, `/src/middleware/security-enhanced.ts`, `/src/config/security.ts`

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Fixes

#### Removed Unsafe Directives for Production
- **Removed `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`** from production CSP
- **Environment-aware CSP**: Development allows unsafe directives, production enforces strict policies
- **Nonce support**: Added nonce generation infrastructure for production inline scripts/styles
- **Enhanced connectSrc**: Removed localhost endpoints from production CSP

#### CSP Configuration
```typescript
// Production CSP (strict)
scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
styleSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],

// Development CSP (relaxed)
scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'"],
styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
```

### 3. Enhanced Security Headers

#### New Security Headers Added
- `Permissions-Policy`: Restricts browser features (camera, microphone, geolocation, etc.)
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`: Disabled DNS prefetching
- `X-Download-Options`: Prevents IE from opening files directly
- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`: Disables Adobe Flash policies
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information sharing
- `X-Robots-Tag`: Prevents search engine indexing (production)

#### Environment-Specific Headers
- **Production**: Strict cache control, HSTS, security monitoring
- **Development**: Relaxed cache control, no HSTS enforcement

### 4. HTTPS Enforcement

#### Environment-Aware HTTPS
- **Development**: HTTPS enforcement disabled for local testing
- **Production**: Strict HTTPS enforcement with 426 status for non-HTTPS requests
- **Staging**: Graceful redirect to HTTPS (301 status)

### 5. Security Reporting

#### New CSP Violation Reporting
- Created `/src/routers/security-reports.ts` for violation reporting
- **CSP Report Endpoint**: `/api/csp-report` for Content Security Policy violations
- **CORS Report Endpoint**: `/api/cors-report` for CORS violations
- **Security Report Endpoint**: `/api/security-report` for other security header violations
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed violation logging with context

### 6. Configuration Files Updated

#### Environment Configuration
- `/src/config/environment.ts`: Core environment-aware configuration
- `/src/config/security.ts`: Security-specific configuration with environment awareness
- `/src/middleware/security.ts`: Legacy security middleware (updated)
- `/src/middleware/security-enhanced.ts`: Enhanced security middleware (updated)

#### Key Configuration Variables
```bash
# Production Environment Variables
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://api.yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production
ENABLE_HTTPS=true

# Development (automatically configured)
# localhost variations automatically allowed
```

## Security Improvements

### Production Security Enhancements
1. **Strict CORS Policy**: Only explicitly configured origins allowed
2. **Secure CSP**: No unsafe directives, nonce support for inline content
3. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Mandatory HTTPS with proper error responses
4. **Enhanced Headers**: Comprehensive security header suite
5. **Violation Reporting**: Real-time security violation monitoring

### Development Experience
1. **Relaxed Policies**: Easier development with localhost support
2. **Detailed Logging**: Clear security decision logging
3. **Error Messages**: Helpful error messages for security violations
4. **Hot Reloading**: Unsafe-eval allowed for development tooling

## Testing Verification

### Production Testing Commands
```bash
# Test CORS rejection
curl -H "Origin: http://malicious-site.com" https://yourapi.com/api/health

# Test HTTPS enforcement
curl -I http://yourapi.com/api/health

# Test security headers
curl -I https://yourapi.com/api/health | grep -E "(X-|Strict-|Content-Security)"

# Test CSP
curl -s https://yourapi.com/api/health | grep -i "content-security-policy"
```

### Development Testing Commands
```bash
# Test CORS allowance
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" http://localhost:9999/api/health

# Test security headers
curl -I http://localhost:9999/api/health
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Set `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable with production domains
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure HTTPS certificates
- [ ] Test CORS policy with actual frontend domains
- [ ] Verify CSP compliance with browser dev tools

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor CSP violation reports at `/api/csp-report`
- [ ] Check security headers with online tools
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Test CORS from actual frontend applications
- [ ] Monitor security logs for violations

## Security Monitoring

### Log Monitoring
Security events are logged with `LogContext.SECURITY`:
- CORS violations
- CSP violations
- HTTPS enforcement events
- Authentication failures
- Rate limit violations

### Alerts Configuration
Critical security violations trigger enhanced logging and can be configured for external alerting systems.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement nonce-based CSP**: Add dynamic nonce generation for inline scripts/styles
2. **Add script/style hashes**: Calculate and whitelist specific inline content hashes
3. **Enhance monitoring**: Integrate with external security monitoring tools
4. **Regular reviews**: Schedule quarterly security header reviews
5. **Automated testing**: Add security header tests to CI/CD pipeline

## Summary

The security middleware has been successfully updated to provide production-ready CORS and CSP configurations while maintaining development flexibility. The implementation follows security best practices and provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for ongoing security posture management.
