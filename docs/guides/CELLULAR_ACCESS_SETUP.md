# Cellular Access Setup Guide
## Universal AI Tools iPhone Companion

### üè† Home Network Setup (Completed ‚úÖ)
- Backend configured to accept network connections
- CORS enabled for mobile access  
- Rate limiting optimized for cellular usage

### üì± iPhone App Connection
Your iPhone app should connect to:
```
Local WiFi: http://192.168.1.213:8082
```

### üåê Cellular Access Options

#### Option 1: Tailscale (Recommended - Easiest)
1. **Install Tailscale on home computer:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscale up
   ```

2. **Install Tailscale app on iPhone from App Store**

3. **Connect both devices to same Tailscale network**

4. **iPhone connects to Tailscale IP:**
   ```
   goAPIGatewayURL = "http://100.x.x.x:8082"  // Tailscale IP
   ```

#### Option 2: Dynamic DNS + Port Forwarding
1. **Router Configuration:**
   - Forward external port 8082 ‚Üí 192.168.1.213:8082
   - Enable UPnP if available

2. **Dynamic DNS Service (choose one):**
   - Duck DNS (free): https://www.duckdns.org
   - No-IP (free): https://www.noip.com
   - DynDNS (paid): https://dyn.com

3. **iPhone connects to:**
   ```
   goAPIGatewayURL = "http://yourname.duckdns.org:8082"
   ```

#### Option 3: VPN Server (Most Secure)
1. **Install WireGuard on home computer:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install wireguard
   # Configure WireGuard server
   ```

2. **iPhone connects via WireGuard VPN**

3. **Uses local IP through VPN tunnel:**
   ```
   goAPIGatewayURL = "http://192.168.1.213:8082"  // Same as home WiFi!
   ```

### üß™ Testing Cellular Connection
1. **Turn off iPhone WiFi**
2. **Open Safari and visit: http://your-setup:8082/api/health**
3. **Should see: {"status":"healthy"}**

### üöÄ Remote App Building
Once cellular access is working, you can:
- Ask iPhone to start building apps while you're out
- Monitor progress via push notifications  
- Review completed code when you get home

### üîí Security Notes
- Development mode has auth disabled for setup
- Enable authentication for production use
- Consider API key authentication for cellular access
- Use HTTPS in production (Let's Encrypt + reverse proxy)

### üìä Performance Expectations
- **Home WiFi**: 20-50ms response time
- **Cellular + Tailscale**: 100-300ms response time  
- **Cellular + Port Forward**: 50-150ms response time
- **Cellular + VPN**: 100-400ms response time

All options provide excellent experience for remote app development!
