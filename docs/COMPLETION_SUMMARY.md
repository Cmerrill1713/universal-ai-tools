```swift
// HTTP client integration with all backend services
class BackendService: ObservableObject {
    private let rustLLMURL = "http://localhost:8003"
    private let goWebSocketURL = "ws://localhost:8002"
    private let typescriptAPIURL = "http://localhost:9999"
}
```

### Week 2-3: JWT Authentication

```rust
// Rust service JWT middleware
async fn auth_middleware(
    headers: HeaderMap,
    request: Request<Body>,
    next: Next<Body>,
) -> Result<Response, StatusCode>
```

### Week 4: Real-time Features
