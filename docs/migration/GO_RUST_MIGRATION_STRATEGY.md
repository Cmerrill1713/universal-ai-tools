## API Compatibility Strategy

### Maintaining Existing Endpoints
1. **Proxy Layer**: Go API Gateway will proxy to existing TypeScript services during migration
2. **Gradual Migration**: Services migrated one at a time with feature flags
3. **API Versioning**: Implement v2 endpoints alongside v1 during transition
4. **Contract Testing**: Ensure API compatibility with automated testing

### Breaking Changes Mitigation
- **Deprecation Warnings**: 30-day notice for any endpoint changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain v1 API for 6 months post-migration
- **Client SDKs**: Update and maintain client libraries throughout transition

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Data Migration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Loss of data during Neo4j/PostgreSQL transitions
   - **Mitigation**: Full database backups, staged migration, rollback procedures

2. **gRPC Communication Failures**
   - **Risk**: Service communication breakdowns between Go/Rust
   - **Mitigation**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, fallback mechanisms

3. **Performance Regression**
   - **Risk**: New services slower than optimized TypeScript
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous benchmarking, performance gates in CI/CD

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Team Learning Curve**
   - **Risk**: Development velocity reduction during transition
   - **Mitigation**: Training programs, paired programming, gradual ramp-up

2. **External Integration Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Breaking changes to Supabase, Ollama, Neo4j integrations
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, vendor communication, fallback options

### Low Risk Areas
1. **Container Deployment**: Docker provides environment consistency
