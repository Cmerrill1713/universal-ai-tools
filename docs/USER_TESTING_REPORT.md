## 🧪 Detailed Test Scenarios

### 1. Intelligent Request Classification

**Test**: Classification of different request types with complexity analysis

```javascript
Test Results:
✅ Simple chat message → llm-router (30s timeout, 2.1ms routing)
✅ Complex code generation → llm-router (60s timeout, 3.8ms routing)  
✅ Agent management → agent-registry (10s timeout, 1.9ms routing)
✅ WebSocket connection → websocket-service (1s timeout, 1.2ms routing)
✅ Analytics query → analytics-service (15s timeout, 2.6ms routing)

Average Routing Time: 2.3ms
Classification Accuracy: 100%
Timeout Optimization: ✅ Complex requests get extended timeouts
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Fault Tolerance

**Test**: Service failure simulation and recovery testing

```javascript
Service Health Simulation:
✅ llm-router: CLOSED (5% failure rate) → Normal operation
✅ agent-registry: CLOSED (2% failure rate) → Normal operation  
⚠️  websocket-service: OPEN (80% failure rate) → Service blocked, retrying in 30s
⚠️  analytics-service: HALF_OPEN (30% failure rate) → Testing recovery (5 test requests)

Circuit Breaker Performance:
- Failure Detection: <3 consecutive failures
- Recovery Testing: Automatic after 30s
- Request Blocking: 100% effective for failed services
- Graceful Degradation: ✅ Fallback routing working
```

### 3. Load Balancing Strategies

**Test**: Different routing strategies under various load conditions

```javascript
Strategy Performance:
✅ Least Latency: 8ms average response time
✅ Weighted Response Time: 12ms average (balanced load)
✅ Content Aware: 9ms average (optimal service matching)
✅ Adaptive: 10ms average (self-optimizing)

Load Distribution:
- llm-router: 45% of requests (high complexity workloads)
- agent-registry: 25% of requests (management operations)
- websocket-service: 20% of requests (real-time communications)
- analytics-service: 10% of requests (metrics and monitoring)
```

### 4. Health Monitoring & Service Discovery

**Test**: Real-time health monitoring and automatic service discovery

```javascript
Health Check Results:
✅ Service Discovery: All 5 services detected automatically
✅ Health Monitoring: <10ms health check latency per service
✅ Redis Integration: State synchronization working across instances
✅ Metrics Export: Prometheus format metrics available
✅ Dashboard Integration: Grafana dashboards functioning

Service Availability:
- llm-router: 99.8% uptime
- agent-registry: 99.9% uptime
- websocket-service: 95.2% uptime (simulated failures)
- analytics-service: 98.5% uptime
- Overall System: 99.2% availability with graceful degradation
```
