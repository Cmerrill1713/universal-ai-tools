# ✅ Docker Memory Optimization Complete

## Changes Applied to docker-compose.yml

### Memory Limits Reduced:
- **App Service**: 3GB → 1GB (67% reduction)
- **Redis**: 2.5GB → 256MB (90% reduction)
- **Neo4j/Ollama**: 6GB → 1GB (83% reduction)
- **Total**: ~12GB → ~3.5GB

### Current Memory Allocations:
```yaml
app:
  memory: 1G      # Main application
redis:
  memory: 256M    # Cache & rate limiting
postgres:
  memory: 512M    # Database (unchanged - already optimal)
ollama:
  memory: 1G      # Local LLM (when needed)
```

## To Start Services with New Limits:

```bash
# Start only what you need
docker-compose up -d redis           # Just Redis (256MB)
docker-compose up -d redis postgres   # Redis + DB (768MB total)
docker-compose up -d app              # Full app (1GB + dependencies)

# Check memory usage
docker stats --no-stream

# Stop when done
docker-compose down
```

## Important: Docker Desktop Settings

**You still need to change Docker Desktop's global limit:**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Settings → Resources
3. Change Memory from 32GB to **8GB** (or 4GB)
4. Apply & Restart

## Results:
- Docker services: Optimized from 12GB to 3.5GB ✅
- Docker Desktop: Needs manual change from 32GB to 8GB ⚠️
- Your SwiftUI app: Only 77MB (excellent!) ✅

The docker-compose.yml is now ready with optimized settings for when you need to start services!
