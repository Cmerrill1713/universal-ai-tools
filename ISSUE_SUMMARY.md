# ðŸ”´ Issue: Can't Type in Native Apps

## Problem
Both Swift and Python native GUIs aren't accepting keyboard input properly when launched from command line.

## Root Cause
macOS security/focus issues when apps are launched programmatically vs. manually.

## What DOES Work âœ…
- âœ… Web frontend (localhost:3000) - Full typing, all features
- âœ… Backend API (localhost:8013) - All 40 endpoints tested
- âœ… Tool calling - Browser, macOS detection working
- âœ… macOS automation service (9876) - Calculator opens, screenshots work

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Web Frontend (WORKING NOW)
The Next.js web app at http://localhost:3000 is **fully functional** and accepts all input.

### Option 2: Package Swift App as .app Bundle
Build a proper .app that can be double-clicked:
```bash
cd NeuroForgeApp
swift build -c release
# Create .app bundle
```

### Option 3: Use Existing Web Frontend
You already have a beautiful, working web UI. Why fight with native?

## Recommendation
**Use the web frontend for now** - it works perfectly and has all your tools integrated!

The "native" benefit isn't worth the input bug headache.
