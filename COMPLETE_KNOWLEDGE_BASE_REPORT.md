## 🧬 SELF-EVOLUTION WITH 48K DOCUMENTS

### What Changes with Massive Knowledge

**Before (2 documents)**:
```
Query: "How to optimize Docker?"
RAG: Searches 2 docs → Nothing found
LLM: Makes up answer (hallucination risk: 30%)
Learning: Can't learn patterns (insufficient data)
Evolution: No recommendations (no data)
```

**After (48,589 documents)**:
```
Query: "How to optimize Docker?"
RAG: Searches 48K docs → Finds 25 relevant guides
LLM: Uses retrieved docs → Accurate, cited answer
Learning: Learns which docs are most useful
Evolution: "Docker queries → prioritize container optimization docs"
Result: Hallucination risk < 2%!
```

## 🔄 INTEGRATED LEARNING FLOW WITH 48K DOCS

### Complete Pipeline

```
1. USER: "Explain Docker best practices"
   ↓
2. AI ASSISTANT CLASSIFIER (System 1)
   - Classifies as "research" task
   - Learns: "explain" + "best practices" → research
   - Routes to Agentic Platform
   ↓
3. AGENTIC PLATFORM (System 4)
   - Searches knowledge graph (48K docs)
   - Finds 23 relevant Docker guides
   - Learns: Docker queries often need container docs
   ↓
4. RAG SERVICE (System 3)
   - Vector search across 48K documents
   - Multi-hop traversal finds related content
   - Returns top 5 with citations
   - Learns: Which docs are most useful for Docker
