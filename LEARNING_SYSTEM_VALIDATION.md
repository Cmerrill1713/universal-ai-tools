- Average latency per backend
- Task type distribution
- Backend usage patterns

**Data Structure**:
```python
{
  "total_routings": 5,
  "overall_success_rate": 1.0,  # 100%
  "by_backend": {
    "ai_assistant": 4,
    "agentic": 1
  },
  "backend_performance": {
    "ai_assistant": {
      "success": 4,
      "total": 4,
      "avg_latency": 0.8
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Test 5: Adaptive Behavior Analysis âœ…
**Purpose**: Check if system adapts to patterns

**Keyword Performance Example**:
```
"function": 3/3 (100%) - Keep, it works well
"write": 3/3 (100%) - Keep, effective
"what is": 2/4 (50%) - Review, inconsistent
"hello": 1/2 (50%) - Monitor
```

**Backend Performance Example**:
```
ai_assistant: 100% success, 0.8s avg
agentic: 100% success, 1.2s avg
evolutionary: Not yet used
```

**Adaptive Actions**:
- Strengthen high-performing routes
- Flag low-performing keywords
- Adjust routing thresholds
- Optimize backend selection

---

### Test 6: Self-Evolution Recommendations ðŸ§¬
**Purpose**: Verify system generates improvement suggestions

**Recommendation Types**:

1. **Remove Keyword**
   - Trigger: Keyword success rate < 50%
   - Action: Suggest removal from classification
   - Example: "Remove 'what is' - only 45% success rate"

2. **Strengthen Route**
   - Trigger: Backend/task pair success rate > 90%
   - Action: Increase routing confidence
   - Example: "code â†’ agentic has 95% success, prioritize"

3. **Review Classification**
   - Trigger: Multiple misroutes of same type
   - Action: Review keywords for that task type
   - Example: "3+ research tasks misrouted, review keywords"

**Threshold for Recommendations**: 10+ routing decisions

---

### Test 7: WebSocket Orchestrator Integration âœ…
**Purpose**: Ensure WebSocket uses the intelligent system

**Integration Check**:
```
âœ… WebSocket using unified orchestrator (RAG + Search + Routing)
```

**What This Enables**:
- Frontend chat uses full agentic system
- RAG prevents hallucinations
- Search supplements knowledge
- Task routing to specialists
- Performance tracking
- Auto-learning from UI interactions

## ðŸ§¬ Self-Evolution Features

### 1. Keyword Optimization
**What It Does**: Tracks which keywords lead to successful routing

**How It Evolves**:
- Monitors keyword â†’ success rate
- Flags keywords with < 50% success
- Suggests removal of poor performers
- Recommends addition of new patterns

**Example Evolution**:
```
Week 1: "what is" used for research â†’ 40% success
Week 2: System recommends removal
Week 3: "what is" removed, success rate improves to 85%
```

---

### 2. Backend Performance Learning
**What It Does**: Tracks which backends excel at which tasks

**How It Evolves**:
- Measures latency per backend
- Calculates success rates
- Identifies optimal routing patterns
- Adjusts backend priorities

**Example Evolution**:
```
Initial: All backends equal priority
After 50 routings: "code â†’ agentic" has 95% success
Evolution: Increase confidence for code â†’ agentic routing
Result: Faster, more accurate code task handling
```

---

### 3. Misroute Detection & Correction
**What It Does**: Identifies when classification was wrong

**How It Evolves**:
- Detects patterns in failed routings
- Groups misroutes by type
- Suggests classification improvements
- Auto-corrects over time

**Example Evolution**:
```
Observation: 5 "research X" messages routed to general chat
Analysis: Missing keywords: "latest", "current", "news"
Recommendation: Add these keywords to research classifier
Result: Research task accuracy improves from 70% to 92%
```

---

### 4. Threshold Auto-Adjustment
**What It Does**: Adjusts routing confidence thresholds

**How It Evolves**:
- Monitors classification confidence
- Correlates confidence with success
- Adjusts thresholds for better accuracy
- Reduces false positives/negatives

**Example Evolution**:
```
Initial: Any keyword match â†’ route to specialist
Problem: Too many false positives
Evolution: Require confidence > 0.7 for specialist routing
Result: Precision improves from 60% to 88%
```
