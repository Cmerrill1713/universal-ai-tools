## Memories

- Utilize Supabase for memory management, context tracking, and coding assistance
- Supabase provides a robust vector database for storing and retrieving contextual memories
- Implement memory storage and retrieval as a core part of the AI tooling ecosystem
- Always use Brave as a tool
- Run with multiple agents in the most efficent manner. Swarm/parallel or just a whole bunch at a time.
- Emphasized the importance of creating a comprehensive memory management system that can dynamically adapt to complex AI workflows

## Production Readiness Status (Updated: 2025-01-20)

### Current Production Readiness: **~35%** - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

#### Critical Issues Identified:
- **Infrastructure**: Performance middleware disabled, GraphQL server non-functional, port management mocked
- **Security**: Development authentication fallbacks, hardcoded test keys, weak CORS configuration
- **Services**: All cognitive agents are mocks, DSPy orchestration system not implemented, Redis infrastructure missing
- **Database**: 41 migrations with conflicts, duplicate tables, SECURITY DEFINER function risks
- **Testing**: Minimal coverage (15%), no API endpoint tests, no security testing

#### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Phase 1 (Critical - 2-3 weeks)**: Re-enable disabled services, remove security fallbacks, consolidate migrations
2. **Phase 2 (High - 3-4 weeks)**: Implement real services (DSPy, agents, Redis), comprehensive testing
3. **Phase 3 (Medium - 2-3 weeks)**: Production hardening, monitoring, load testing

#### Key Production Configuration Requirements:
- Environment variables must be validated and secured (no development fallbacks)
- All services must have real implementations (no mocks in production)
- Database migrations must be consolidated and tested
- Security hardening service must be enabled with proper monitoring
- Comprehensive test coverage (minimum 80%) required before deployment

See `PRODUCTION_CONFIGURATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` for detailed configuration specifications.

## Production Readiness Action Plan Memories

- Created a comprehensive PRODUCTION_READINESS_ACTION_PLAN.md with a detailed roadmap to increase production readiness from 35% to 95%+ over 7-10 weeks
- Plan includes three distinct phases:
  1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Critical Infrastructure - Fixing all P0 blockers
  2. Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7): Real Services - Replacing all mocks
  3. Phase 3 (Weeks 8-10): Production Hardening - Ensuring enterprise reliability
- Developed a day-by-day breakdown with specific tasks, file locations, line numbers, success metrics, time estimates, and dependencies
- Established a daily workflow guide with morning validation commands, development workflow, and end-of-day checklist
- Defined team structure with 4 developer roles, clear ownership areas, and specified communication channels
- Implemented progress tracking with milestone checkboxes, Go/No-Go decision points, and risk mitigation strategies
- Created emergency procedures including early deployment protocols, hotfix procedures, and rollback plans
- Emphasized that NO production deployment should occur until Phase 1 is 100% complete due to critical security and stability risks
- Designed the plan as a living document to be updated daily, usable by project managers, developers, leadership, and QA team
