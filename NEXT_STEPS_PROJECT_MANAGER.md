# Ensure server includes project manager routes
npm run dev  # Verify integration works
curl http://localhost:9999/api/health  # Confirm system health
```

### 3. **Create Project Manager Web UI** 🎨 (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State**: CLI/API-based system  
**Enhancement**: Web-based project dashboard  
**Recommended Implementation**:
- React-based project dashboard
- Real-time project status monitoring
- Interactive project creation/management
- Integration with existing Universal AI Tools UI

**File Structure**:
```
src/ui/project-manager/
├── components/
│   ├── ProjectList.tsx
│   ├── ProjectCard.tsx
│   ├── TaskTimeline.tsx
│   └── AgentActivity.tsx
├── pages/
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── ProjectDetail.tsx
│   └── Settings.tsx
└── services/
    └── projectManagerApi.ts
```

### 4. **Enhance Monitoring & Analytics** 📊 (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add to existing monitoring service
interface ProjectAnalytics {
  completionRates: number[];
  qualityTrends: QualityMetric[];
  agentPerformance: AgentMetric[];
  resourceUtilization: ResourceMetric[];
}
```

### 5. **Expand Project Templates** 📋 (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current Support**: Detected from existing projects  
**Enhancement**: Pre-built project templates  
**Recommended Templates**:
- React + TypeScript web applications
- Node.js + Express APIs
- Python data processing pipelines
- Flutter mobile applications
- Docker containerized services

### 6. **Advanced Features** 🔮 (FUTURE)

**Phase 2 Enhancements** (Next 90 days):
- Machine learning for project estimation
- Automated testing integration  
- Advanced dependency management
- Multi-language project support
- Custom agent development tools

**Phase 3 Enterprise Features** (Next 180 days):
- Project portfolio management
- Resource planning and optimization
- Advanced collaboration features

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Guidance

### For Adding New Project Types

```typescript
// Example: Adding Flutter project support
interface FlutterProjectConfig {
  dartSdkVersion: string;
  flutterVersion: string;
  platforms: ('ios' | 'android' | 'web' | 'desktop')[];
  dependencies: Record<string, string>;
}

class FlutterProjectHandler extends BaseProjectHandler {
  async analyze(projectPath: string): Promise<ProjectAnalysis> {
    // Analyze pubspec.yaml, lib/ structure, etc.
  }
  
  async generateTasks(): Promise<ProjectTask[]> {
    // Create Flutter-specific tasks
  }
}
```

### For Custom Agent Integration

```typescript
// Example: Adding specialized Flutter agent
interface FlutterAgent extends EnhancedBaseAgent {
  capabilities: [
    'dart_development',
    'flutter_widgets',
    'state_management', 
    'platform_integration'
  ];
}

// Register with agent registry
agentRegistry.register('flutter-expert', new FlutterAgent(config));
```

### For Advanced Monitoring

```typescript
// Enhanced project metrics collection
class AdvancedProjectMetrics {
  collectCodeQualityMetrics(project: Project): QualityMetrics;
  trackAgentPerformance(agentId: string): PerformanceMetrics;
  analyzeResourceUtilization(): ResourceMetrics;
  generatePredictiveInsights(): PredictiveAnalysis;
}
```
