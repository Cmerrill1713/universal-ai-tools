Prometheus                0.23%   60.08MB   +10MB (+20%)*
Zipkin                    0.16%  206.6MB   -25MB (-11%)
Jaeger                    0.01%   15.84MB   +1MB (+7%)
Tempo                     0.04%   29.35MB   -4MB (-12%)
Alertmanager             0.09%   18.88MB   +1MB (+6%)

Total Memory Usage:      470MB   (-43MB / -8.4%)
Total CPU Usage:         <1%     (Excellent efficiency)
```
*Prometheus increase expected due to active metric collection

### 🔧 Configuration Improvements

#### 1. OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration
```yaml
# BEFORE: Failed scraping non-existent services
- 'llm-router:9001'
- 'agent-registry:9002'  
- 'websocket-service:9003'
- 'analytics-service:9004'
- 'intelligent-load-balancer:9090'

# AFTER: Only operational services
- job_name: 'otel-collector'
  targets: ['localhost:8888']
```

#### 2. Trace Sampling Optimization
```yaml
# BEFORE: 100% sampling (development)
sampling_percentage: 100

# AFTER: 25% sampling (production-ready)
sampling_percentage: 25
```

#### 3. Zipkin Memory Optimization
```yaml
# BEFORE: Default JVM settings
JAVA_OPTS=-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions

# AFTER: Optimized memory allocation
JAVA_OPTS=-Xms128m -Xmx384m -XX:+UseG1GC
```

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Enhancements

#### 1. Persistent Storage Implementation
- **Data Directories**: Created ./data/{tempo,grafana,prometheus,otel}
- **Volume Binds**: Configured persistent storage for all services
- **Backup Ready**: Data now survives container restarts

#### 2. Production Deployment Configuration
- **Security**: Restricted UI access to localhost only
- **Authentication**: Grafana password stored in secrets
- **SSL/TLS**: Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination
- **Cassandra**: Persistent storage backend for Jaeger and Zipkin
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints for all services

### 🧪 End-to-End Validation

#### Trace Flow Verification
1. **✅ Trace Generation**: Python test script executed successfully
2. **✅ OTLP Reception**: OpenTelemetry Collector receiving traces
3. **✅ Multi-Backend Export**: Traces flowing to Jaeger, Zipkin, and Tempo
4. **✅ UI Accessibility**: All web interfaces responding correctly
5. **✅ Metrics Collection**: Prometheus scraping operational services only

#### Service Health Checks
- **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686 ✅ Healthy
- **Zipkin UI**: http://localhost:9411 ✅ Healthy  
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 ✅ Healthy
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090 ✅ Healthy
- **Tempo**: http://localhost:3200 ✅ Ready
- **OTel Collector**: http://localhost:13133 ✅ Healthy

### 📈 Performance Benchmarks

#### Trace Processing Performance
