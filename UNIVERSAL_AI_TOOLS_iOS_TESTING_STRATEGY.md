  deviceContext: MobileDeviceContext;
  taskComplexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  domain: string[];
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
}

interface AgentRecommendation {
  primaryAgent: string;
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  fallbackAgents: string[];
  estimatedResponseTime: number;
  batteryImpact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

#### Selection Criteria
1. **Context Analysis**
   - Natural language processing of user input
   - Pattern matching for domain expertise
   - Task complexity assessment
   - Historical success patterns

2. **Device Optimization**
   - Battery level considerations
   - Network connectivity type
   - Processing capability assessment
   - Power mode optimization

3. **Performance Learning**
   - Track agent success rates by task type
   - User satisfaction feedback
   - Response time optimization
   - Context-specific performance metrics

#### Implementation Approach
- Use Athena agent as the intelligent dispatcher
- Implement ML-based classification for task categorization
