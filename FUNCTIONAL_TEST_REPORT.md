# Universal AI Tools - Functional Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-09-06
## App Version: Universal AI Tools (macOS)

---

## Executive Summary

### Dashboard Screenshot Analysis
The Dashboard UI shown in the screenshot **does not exist in the current codebase**. After extensive searching:
- ‚ùå No source files contain "What beauty shall we create tonight?"
- ‚ùå No files contain "Connected & Listening" status
- ‚ùå No files contain the specific sidebar items shown (Streaming Chat, Voice Chat, etc.)
- **Conclusion**: The screenshot appears to be a design mockup or prototype, not actual running code

## Testing Matrix

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Window Management** | ‚úÖ | Properly sized at 1200x800 |
| **Backend Connection** | ‚úÖ | Connected to 127.0.0.1:8080 |
| **Sidebar Navigation** | ‚úÖ | Three sections working |
| **Chat Functionality** | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Basic UI working, needs backend integration |
| **Tasks Management** | ‚úÖ | UI implemented, needs persistence |
| **Projects Management** | ‚úÖ | UI implemented, needs persistence |
| **Search** | ‚úÖ | UI functional |
| **Settings** | üîß | Basic structure, needs expansion |
| **Voice Features** | ‚ùå | UI only, no backend |
| **MCP Integration** | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Service initialized, not fully integrated |

## Identified Issues

### Critical
1. **Window Corner Rounding** - Top left corner not rounded (OS-level limitation)
2. **Data Persistence** - Tasks and Projects not saved between sessions

### Medium Priority
1. **Voice Integration** - Voice recording UI present but not functional
2. **File Upload** - Drag-and-drop area exists but doesn't process files
3. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connections not established

### Low Priority
1. **Animations** - Some transitions could be smoother
2. **Dark Mode** - Partial implementation
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Limited keyboard navigation

## Backend Service Status

```
Server: ‚úÖ Running on port 8080
Health Check: ‚úÖ Responding correctly
API Endpoints: ‚úÖ Available
WebSocket: ‚ö†Ô∏è Server running but client not connecting
Database: ‚úÖ Supabase connected
Redis: ‚úÖ Cache operational
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement data persistence for Tasks and Projects
2. Complete WebSocket integration for real-time updates
3. Fix voice recording backend integration

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement the sophisticated Dashboard design from the mockup
2. Add proper user authentication
3. Implement file upload and processing
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. Complete dark/light mode toggle

## Test Environment

- **OS**: macOS 15.0 (24A335)
- **Xcode**: 16.0
- **Swift**: 6.0
- **Backend**: Node.js server on localhost:8080
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis on port 6379

---

## Conclusion

The Universal AI Tools app is functional with basic chat capabilities and newly added Tasks/Projects sections. The backend connection is working correctly. However, the sophisticated Dashboard shown in the screenshot does not exist in the current implementation and appears to be a design goal rather than current reality.

**Overall App Status**: üü° **Partially Functional** - Core features work but many advanced features need implementation
