## Date: $(date)

### 1. ✅ Fixed Force Unwrapped URLs
- Replaced all force-unwrapped URL creations with safe optional handling
- Added proper error handling for URL creation failures
- Implemented `createURL()` and `createRequest()` helper methods

### 2. ✅ Fixed WebSocket Memory Leak
- Replaced recursive WebSocket message handling with while loop
- Added `isReceivingMessages` flag to prevent multiple receive loops
- Implemented proper WebSocket disconnection in `deinit`

### 3. ✅ Fixed Thread Safety Issues
- Replaced `DispatchQueue.main.async` with `Task { @MainActor in }`
- Added `@MainActor` annotations to UI update methods
- Implemented `updateProximitySafely()` for thread-safe updates

### 4. ✅ Added Comprehensive Error Handling
- Implemented `handleAPIError()` for network error categorization
- Added `withTimeout()` for request timeouts
- Implemented `retryableRequest()` with exponential backoff

### 5. ✅ Fixed Bluetooth Permission Checking
- Added `checkBluetoothPermissions()` before starting detection
- Proper handling of all authorization states
- Clear error messages for permission issues

### 6. ✅ Implemented Secure Token Storage
- JWT tokens stored in Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`
- Device ID migrated from UserDefaults to Keychain
- Private keys stored securely with proper access controls

### 7. ✅ Added Network Reachability Monitoring
- Implemented `NetworkMonitor` class using Network framework
- Real-time network status updates
- Connection type detection (WiFi, Cellular, etc.)

### 8. ✅ Added Retry Logic
- Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Configurable max attempts and delay
- Proper error propagation

### 9. ✅ Fixed Memory Retain Cycles
- Weak delegate references in ProximityDetectionService
- Weak delegate references in WatchConnectivityService
- Proper cleanup in deinit

### 10. ✅ Added Proper Deinitialization
- WebSocket disconnection in deinit
- Proximity detection cleanup
- Network monitor cleanup

## Additional Security Enhancements

### Certificate Pinning (To Be Implemented)
```swift
// TODO: Implement certificate pinning for production
// Use URLSession delegate to validate server certificates
// Pin to specific public keys or certificates
```

### Secure Enclave for RSA Keys (To Be Implemented)
```swift
// TODO: Use Secure Enclave for key generation when available
// Check for Secure Enclave availability
// Generate keys with kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Force Unwrap Testing**: Try invalid URLs to ensure no crashes
2. **Memory Leak Testing**: Use Instruments to verify no WebSocket leaks
3. **Thread Safety Testing**: Test rapid UI updates from background
4. **Network Testing**: Test with airplane mode and network transitions
5. **Keychain Testing**: Verify tokens persist across app launches

## Next Steps

1. Implement certificate pinning for production deployment
2. Add Secure Enclave support for compatible devices
3. Add biometric re-authentication for sensitive operations
4. Implement token refresh mechanism
5. Add security audit logging
