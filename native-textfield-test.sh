echo "🔧 Native TextField Test Ready!"
echo "==============================="
echo

echo "🎯 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "======================"
echo "• SwiftUI TextField focus works (🎯 Text field focus: true)"
echo "• But no text input events (missing 🔤 Text input changed)"
echo "• This indicates SwiftUI TextField is broken in pop-out windows"
echo "• Need to use native NSTextField instead"
echo

echo "🔧 NATIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "==============================="
echo "• Created NativeTextField using NSViewRepresentable"
echo "• Uses NSTextField with becomeFirstResponder()"
echo "• Direct text change callbacks via Coordinator"
echo "• Bypasses SwiftUI focus management entirely"
echo

echo "🎨 NATIVE TEXTFIELD FEATURES:"
echo "============================="
echo "• NSTextField with rounded bezel style"
echo "• Immediate focus with becomeFirstResponder()"
echo "• Direct text change detection via @objc methods"
echo "• Native macOS text input behavior"
echo "• No SwiftUI focus state dependencies"
echo

echo "🚀 TEST THE NATIVE APPROACH:"
echo "============================"
echo "1. Launch app: cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "2. Run in Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "3. Click 'General Chat' button"
echo "4. Try typing in the native text field"
echo "5. Watch for: 🔤 Native text input changed: '[your text]'"
echo

echo "🔍 EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:"
echo "========================="
echo "• 💬 NativeChatView appeared"
echo "• 🎯 NativeTextField became first responder"
echo "• 🔤 Native text input changed: '[your text]' (when typing)"
echo

echo "💡 WHY THIS SHOULD WORK:"
echo "========================"
echo "• NSTextField is the native macOS text input"
echo "• No SwiftUI focus management complexity"
echo "• Direct becomeFirstResponder() call"
echo "• Native text change callbacks"
echo "• Bypasses all SwiftUI focus issues"
echo

echo "🎉 This should finally allow typing in the text field!"
