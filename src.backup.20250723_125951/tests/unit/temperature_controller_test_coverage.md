# Temperature Controller Test Coverage

## Overview

Comprehensive unit test suite for the Task-Aware Temperature Controller with 33 tests covering all major functionality.

## Test Categories

### 1. Task-Specific Temperature Profiles (2 tests)

- ✅ Verifies correct temperature ranges for all task types
- ✅ Handles unknown task types with fallback to general profile

### 2. Context-Based Adjustments (4 tests)

- ✅ Adjusts temperature based on complexity level
- ✅ Respects user preferences within bounds
- ✅ Increases temperature for retry attempts
- ✅ Adjusts for quality requirements (speed/balanced/quality)

### 3. Complementary Parameters (2 tests)

- ✅ Calculates appropriate top-p, top-k, and repetition penalties
- ✅ Sets presence/frequency penalties for high temperatures only

### 4. Learning and Optimization (4 tests)

- ✅ Records generation results for future optimization
- ✅ Updates optimal temperature using gradient descent
- ✅ Maintains quality score with exponential moving average
- ✅ Requires sufficient data before applying learned optimizations

### 5. Recommendations (2 tests)

- ✅ Provides comprehensive recommendations for all task types
- ✅ Includes learned temperatures when available

### 6. Edge Cases and Error Handling (6 tests)

- ✅ Handles unknown task types gracefully
- ✅ Handles partial task type matches
- ✅ Handles extreme user preferences (too high/negative)
- ✅ Handles excessive retry attempts with cap
- ✅ Handles null quality scores in recordResult
- ✅ Handles database errors gracefully

### 7. A/B Testing (2 tests)

- ✅ Occasionally applies A/B test variations (10% sample rate)
- ✅ Keeps variations within profile bounds

### 8. Persistence and Loading (3 tests)

- ✅ Loads existing metrics on initialization
- ✅ Saves metrics after recording results
- ✅ Handles save errors gracefully

### 9. Singleton Pattern (2 tests)

- ✅ Always returns the same instance
- ✅ Maintains state across getInstance calls

### 10. Parameter Calculation (4 tests)

- ✅ Calculates all complementary parameters correctly
- ✅ Calculates top-p inversely to temperature
- ✅ Doesn't set penalties for low temperatures
- ✅ Handles all task types in profiles

### 11. Complex Context Handling (2 tests)

- ✅ Handles multiple context factors simultaneously
- ✅ Prioritizes user preference over other adjustments

## Key Testing Patterns

1. **Mocking**: Properly mocks Supabase service and Math.random for controlled testing
2. **Singleton Reset**: Resets singleton instance between tests to ensure isolation
3. **Async Handling**: Properly waits for async operations with timeouts
4. **Boundary Testing**: Tests extreme values and edge cases
5. **Error Simulation**: Tests error handling by simulating database failures

## Coverage Highlights

- All public methods tested
- All task types covered
- Error conditions handled
- A/B testing behavior verified
- Learning algorithm tested
- Persistence layer mocked and tested
