### Known Patterns & Gotchas
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Universal AI Tools specific patterns for autonomous coding

// 1. MANDATORY: All LLM calls must use enhanced context injection with code-specific context
const { enrichedPrompt, codeContext } = await contextInjectionService.enrichWithContext(
  userRequest,
  { 
    userId, 
    workingDirectory, 
    currentProject, 
    sessionId,
    // NEW: Code-specific context
    astAnalysis: astContext,
    repositoryPatterns: repoPatterns,
    securityRequirements: securityContext,
    qualityStandards: qualityMetrics
  }
);

// 2. SECURITY: All generated code must pass security validation
const securityScanResult = await securityScanningService.validateCode(generatedCode, {
  language: detectedLanguage,
  context: codeContext,
  vulnerabilityThreshold: 'zero-tolerance'
});

// 3. MLX Integration: Repository-specific model fine-tuning
const customModel = await mlxFineTuningService.createRepositoryModel({
  baseModel: 'codellama:7b-instruct',
  repositoryData: extractedPatterns,
  optimizations: ['lora', '4bit-quantization'],
  targetMetrics: { accuracy: 0.95, latency: 500 }
});

// 4. AB-MCTS: Probabilistic model selection based on code complexity
const selectedModel = await abMctsOrchestrator.selectOptimalModel({
  taskComplexity: astComplexityScore,
  qualityRequirements: qualityStandards,
  performanceConstraints: { maxLatency: 500, maxTokens: 8192 },
  explorationRate: 0.3
});

// 5. DSPy Orchestration: Multi-agent code generation pipeline
const codeGenerationChain = await dspyOrchestrator.executeChain([
  'semantic-analyzer',    // Understand code requirements
  'context-injector',     // Enrich with repository context
  'pattern-detector',     // Identify coding patterns
  'security-validator',   // Check security requirements
  'code-synthesizer',     // Generate code solution
  'quality-assessor',     // Evaluate code quality
  'performance-optimizer', // Optimize for performance
  'integration-tester'    // Validate integration compatibility
]);

// 6. Quality Gates: Multi-tier validation before code delivery
const validationPipeline = {
  syntaxValidation: 'tree-sitter-parsing',
  logicValidation: 'automated-testing',
  securityValidation: 'vulnerability-scanning',
  performanceValidation: 'runtime-analysis',
  integrationValidation: 'compatibility-testing'
};
```

## Advanced Architecture Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't bypass context injection service - mandatory for repository awareness
- ❌ Don't store repository tokens in environment variables - use Supabase vault
- ❌ Don't create isolated code generation services - integrate with AB-MCTS orchestration
- ❌ Don't ignore existing DSPy cognitive chains - leverage for complex reasoning
- ❌ Don't skip security validation - implement zero-tolerance vulnerability policies
- ❌ Don't bypass MLX fine-tuning opportunities - use for repository-specific optimization
- ❌ Don't ignore intelligent parameter automation - essential for optimal code generation
- ❌ Don't implement without Tree-sitter integration - required for real-time AST analysis
- ❌ Don't forget comprehensive monitoring - track code quality, security, and performance metrics
