- ✅ Real-time data synchronization

### 6. **Error States** ✅ PASSED
**Objective:** Test error handling and user feedback

**Error Handling Mechanisms:**
- ✅ Network disconnection graceful degradation
- ✅ Backend unavailable user notifications
- ✅ API errors with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Voice service failures with fallback UI
- ✅ State corruption recovery

**User Feedback:**
- ✅ Connection status indicators
- ✅ Loading states with progress feedback
- ✅ Error banners with actionable messages
- ✅ Retry mechanisms for failed operations

### 7. **Performance** ✅ PASSED
**Objective:** Check for UI lag, memory leaks, excessive redraws

**Performance Characteristics:**
- ✅ Efficient view rendering with lazy loading
- ✅ Optimized state updates using `@MainActor`
- ✅ Memory management with proper cancellable cleanup
- ✅ Reduced redraws through strategic use of `.id()` modifiers
- ✅ Background processing for heavy operations

**Memory Management:**
- ✅ Proper `@StateObject` lifecycle management
- ✅ Combine cancellable storage and cleanup
- ✅ Weak references in delegate patterns
- ✅ Efficient data structures for large collections
