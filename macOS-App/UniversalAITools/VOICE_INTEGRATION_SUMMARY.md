# Voice Endpoint Integration Summary

## Overview

The Swift APIService has been successfully updated to integrate with the backend voice endpoints, replacing mock implementations with real HTTP calls. This provides a complete bridge between the macOS application and the Universal AI Tools backend voice services.

## Updated Components

### 1. APIService.swift - Voice Extension

**New Methods Added:**

#### Voice Chat Integration
- `sendVoiceMessage(_:voiceSettings:) -> VoiceResponse`
  - Sends messages to `POST /api/v1/voice/chat`
  - Supports voice customization (voice, speed, pitch, emotion)
  - Returns both text response and audio data/URL
  - Includes proper authentication and error handling

#### Audio Transcription
- `transcribeAudio(audioData:language:model:) -> TranscriptionResponse`
  - Uploads audio to `POST /api/v1/voice/transcribe`
  - Supports multipart/form-data uploads
  - Optional language and model specification
  - Returns detailed transcription with confidence scores and word-level timing

#### Speech Synthesis
- `synthesizeSpeech(text:voice:settings:) -> SynthesisResponse`
  - Converts text to speech via `POST /api/v1/voice/synthesize`
  - Configurable voice parameters (speed, pitch, volume, emotion, format)
  - Returns audio data (base64) or download URL
  - Includes playback helper methods

#### Audio Playback
- `playSynthesizedAudio(from:)` - Plays audio from synthesis response
- `playAudioData(_:)` - Handles raw audio data playback

#### Health Monitoring
- `checkVoiceServicesHealth() -> VoiceServicesHealth`
  - Checks availability of all voice services
  - Returns service status, capabilities, and performance metrics

#### Error Handling & Retry Logic
- `retryVoiceOperation(_:maxRetries:baseDelay:)` - Exponential backoff retry
- Comprehensive error handling for network, authentication, and parsing errors
- User-friendly error messages

### 2. Voice Response Types

**New Data Models:**
- `VoiceSettings` - Voice customization parameters
- `SynthesisSettings` - Speech synthesis configuration
- `VoiceResponse` - Voice chat endpoint response
- `TranscriptionResponse` - Audio transcription response
- `SynthesisResponse` - Speech synthesis response
- `VoiceServicesHealth` - Service health and capabilities

**Response Structure:**
```swift
struct VoiceResponse: Codable {
    let success: Bool
    let data: VoiceResponseData      // Message, audio data/URL, duration
    let metadata: VoiceResponseMetadata  // Request ID, timing, model info
}
```

### 3. WebSocket Integration

**Voice Event Handling:**
- `voice_transcription_update` - Real-time transcription updates
- `voice_synthesis_complete` - Synthesis completion notifications
- `voice_interaction_started` - Voice session start
- `voice_interaction_ended` - Voice session end

**Notification Extensions:**
- Added voice-specific notification names to `Utils/Notifications.swift`
- Integrated with existing WebSocket message handling

### 4. Authentication & Security

**Features:**
- Automatic API key inclusion in headers
- Fallback to unauthenticated requests when appropriate
- Secure token management integration
- Request timeout configurations (60s for voice, 120s for transcription)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Voice Chat
```swift
let voiceSettings = VoiceSettings(voice: "en-US-Aria", speed: 1.0, pitch: 1.0)
let response = try await apiService.sendVoiceMessage(
    "Hello, how can you help me?",
    voiceSettings: voiceSettings
)
print("Response: \(response.data.message)")
```

### Audio Transcription
```swift
let response = try await apiService.transcribeAudio(
    audioData: audioData,
    language: "en-US",
    model: "whisper-large-v3"
)
print("Transcription: \(response.data.text)")
```

### Speech Synthesis
```swift
let settings = SynthesisSettings(speed: 1.0, pitch: 1.0, format: "wav")
let response = try await apiService.synthesizeSpeech(
    text: "Hello world",
    voice: "en-US-Aria",
    settings: settings
)
try await apiService.playSynthesizedAudio(from: response)
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Services

**STTService Integration:**
- Can send local transcriptions to voice chat endpoint
- Option to use backend transcription instead of local Speech framework
- Hybrid approaches for better accuracy

**TTSService Integration:**
- Backend synthesis with local playback
- Fallback to local TTS when backend unavailable
- Quality comparison between local and backend voices

**WebSocket Integration:**
- Real-time voice event notifications
- Bidirectional communication for voice sessions
- Status updates and progress tracking

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Types
- `APIError.invalidURL` - Configuration issues
- `APIError.httpError(statusCode)` - HTTP status errors (401, 429, 5xx)
- `APIError.networkError` - Network connectivity issues
- `APIError.decodingError` - Response parsing errors

### Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- No retry for authentication errors (4xx)
- Configurable retry attempts and delays

### User-Friendly Messages
- Specific error descriptions for common issues
- Recovery suggestions for different error types
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## Backward Compatibility

### Maintained Features
- All existing APIService methods remain unchanged
- WebSocket connection handling preserved
- Authentication system unchanged
- Error handling patterns consistent

### Safe Integration
- Voice methods are additive, not replacing existing functionality
- Optional parameters with sensible defaults
- Graceful degradation when voice services unavailable

## Performance Considerations

### Timeouts
- Voice chat: 60 seconds (processing can be intensive)
- Transcription: 120 seconds (large audio files)
- Synthesis: 60 seconds (text processing)

### Data Handling
- Efficient multipart uploads for audio
- Base64 encoding for audio responses
- Optional URL-based audio delivery for large files

### Memory Management
- Streaming uploads for large audio files
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data
- Proper async/await usage to prevent blocking

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Streaming Audio Support** - Real-time audio streaming for live conversations
2. **Voice Cloning Integration** - Custom voice training and deployment
3. **Audio Format Optimization** - Automatic format selection based on use case
4. **Caching Strategy** - Local caching of frequently used voice responses
5. **Analytics Integration** - Voice usage metrics and quality monitoring

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Core ML Integration** - Local voice processing fallbacks
2. **Shortcuts Support** - Voice commands via Siri Shortcuts
3. **Accessibility Features** - Enhanced support for voice navigation
4. **Multi-language Support** - Dynamic language switching
5. **Voice Biometrics** - Speaker identification and verification

## Testing
