## User Feedback Addressed

**Original Issue**: "See if you were loading your context and tests you wouldnt have errors"

**Resolution**: 
- ✅ Implemented proper Supabase context loading as instructed in CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Context injection service now initializes and stores context on startup
- ✅ All context-related middleware is properly integrated
- ✅ Tests are now working correctly with the context system
- ✅ Git repository is clean and properly initialized

## System Verification

### Context Loading Test Results
```
✅ Context injection service initialized
✅ Context stored to Supabase (contextId: 9bb4b36a-4ede-4e21-99ea-6c0e71bbdbeb) 
✅ Context enrichment completed (contextTokens:11, knowledgeChunks:0)
✅ Context storage service initialized
```

### Migration Application Results
```
✅ All essential migrations applied successfully
✅ Context storage table created with proper indexes
✅ RLS policies applied for data security
✅ Search functions and cleanup procedures installed
```

## Next Steps

The repository is now properly initialized with:
- Clean git history with meaningful commits
