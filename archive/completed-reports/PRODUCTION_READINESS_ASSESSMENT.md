- Export declaration conflicts
```

#### 2. Production Code Quality

```
- Remove 315 mock references from production paths
- Address 610 hardcoded development values
- Resolve 3,146 critical linting errors
- Fix parsing errors in test files
```

#### 3. Dependency Management

```
- Update xml2js to resolve prototype pollution
- Fix ESLint version conflicts
- Resolve peer dependency warnings
- Update blessed-contrib to secure version
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (24-48 hours)

1. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Fix missing type declarations
   - Resolve interface conflicts
   - Add missing dependencies
   - Update imports and exports

2. **Code Quality Triage**
   - Remove mocks from production code
   - Replace hardcoded values with environment variables
   - Fix critical linting errors (focus on errors, defer warnings)

3. **Security Dependencies**
   - Update vulnerable packages
   - Rotate expired API keys
   - Remove insecure patterns

### Phase 2: Production Preparation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Testing Validation**
   - Ensure all tests pass with clean build
   - Validate self-improvement system in isolated environment
   - Performance testing with production data

2. **Deployment Infrastructure**
   - Set up production monitoring
   - Configure automated backups
   - Implement rollback procedures

### Phase 3: Gradual Deployment (2-4 weeks)

1. **Staged Rollout**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Limited production pilot
   - Full production deployment

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### Option 1: Full Fix Approach (Recommended)

- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks
- **Effort:** High (160-240 hours)
- **Outcome:** Production-ready system with enterprise quality
- **Risk:** Low deployment risk, high confidence

### Option 2: Minimal Viable Deployment

- **Timeline:** 1 week
- **Effort:** Medium (80-120 hours)
- **Outcome:** Basic functional deployment with known technical debt
- **Risk:** Medium deployment risk, ongoing maintenance burden

### Option 3: Research/Demo Mode

- **Timeline:** Current state
- **Effort:** Low (maintenance only)
- **Outcome:** Functional for demonstration and development
- **Risk:** Not suitable for production workloads
