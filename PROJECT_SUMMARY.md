# Universal AI Tools - Project Summary

## What This Is
A sophisticated AI tools platform that combines local LLMs, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and a beautiful macOS app.

## Key Features Recently Implemented
- ✅ RAG system with semantic search
- ✅ Local LLM integration (Ollama/LM Studio)
- ✅ SwiftUI macOS app with RAG controls
- ✅ Knowledge graph with Graph-R1
- ✅ Auto-context detection
- ✅ Beautiful UI with glassmorphism effects

## Architecture
- **Local LLM Server**: Port 7456 (unauthenticated, RAG-enabled)
- **Main Server**: Port 9999 (authenticated APIs)
- **Database**: Supabase with vector embeddings
- **Graph DB**: Neo4j for knowledge graphs
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI macOS app

## Recent Work
We just completed a comprehensive RAG system integration that allows the local LLMs to retrieve relevant context from the knowledge base. The SwiftUI app now has beautiful controls for enabling RAG, adjusting context amounts, and viewing source attributions.

## Testing Status
- ✅ Local LLM server running
- ✅ Basic chat working
- ✅ RAG parameters accepted
- ✅ SwiftUI integration complete
- ⚠️ RAG endpoints need build deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the new build with RAG endpoints
2. Test full RAG workflow
3. Index more content into knowledge base
4. Build and test macOS app
