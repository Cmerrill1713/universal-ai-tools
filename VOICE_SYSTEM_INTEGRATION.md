## 🔗 Integration Points

### macOS App ↔ Backend Communication

    F --> G[Voice Response]
    G --> H[TTS Synthesis]
    H --> I[Audio Playback]
```

### Voice Interaction Flow

1. **Voice Input**: User speaks → STTService transcribes → Text sent to backend
2. **AI Processing**: Backend voice agent processes text → Generates response
3. **Voice Output**: Response sent to frontend → TTSService synthesizes → Audio playback

### Command Processing Flow

1. **Voice Command**: User speaks command → Command detection
2. **Pattern Matching**: Command parsed and classified
3. **Execution**: Command executed with confirmation
4. **Feedback**: Visual and audio confirmation provided

## 🎯 Voice Agent Capabilities

The conversational voice agent provides five core capabilities:

1. **voice_conversation** - Natural voice-based conversation with context awareness
2. **voice_command_processing** - Processing and execution of voice commands
3. **conversational_memory** - Maintaining conversation context across interactions
4. **voice_response_optimization** - Optimizing responses for natural speech synthesis
5. **emotion_detection** - Detecting emotional context for appropriate responses

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Voice Recognition Settings
- Language selection (en-US, en-GB, es-ES, fr-FR)
- Recognition sensitivity adjustment
- Timeout configuration
- Audio input device selection

### Voice Synthesis Settings
- Voice selection from 8 premium voices
- Speed adjustment (0.5x - 2.0x)
- Volume control (0% - 100%)
- Emotion-based voice modulation

### Interaction Modes
- **Conversational**: Natural back-and-forth dialogue
- **Command**: Direct command execution
- **Dictation**: Text capture and formatting
- **Assistant**: Task-oriented assistance

### Personality Styles
