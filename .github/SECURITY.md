1. Create a GitHub issue with the `security` label
2. Provide detailed reproduction steps
3. Include potential impact assessment

## Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning and updates
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Vulnerability tracking and remediation
- **SARIF Integration**: Code scanning with security-focused tools

### Development Security

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Security validation before commits
- **Dependency Pinning**: Exact version dependencies for reproducible builds  
- **Secrets Management**: Supabase Vault for secure API key storage
- **Environment Isolation**: Development vs production environment separation

### Runtime Security

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation middleware
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **API Key Management**: Multi-tenant API key authentication

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Minimal Docker images and non-root users
- **Network Isolation**: Service-to-service communication via internal networks
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and alerting
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits to prevent resource exhaustion

## Security Compliance

This project follows security best practices:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Secure Coding Standards**: TypeScript/Rust/Go security guidelines
- **Regular Updates**: Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for new threats

## Disclosure Timeline

For security vulnerabilities:

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial triage and confirmation
3. **Day 3-7**: Investigation and patch development
4. **Day 8-14**: Testing and validation
5. **Day 15**: Public disclosure and release
