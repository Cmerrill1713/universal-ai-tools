## 🔄 Agent Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Agent Handoffs
```
Claude Code → Task Agent → Specialist Agent → Quality Guardian → Performance Engineer
```
**Used for**: Complex features requiring multiple specializations

### Pattern 2: Parallel Agent Execution  
```
Task Agent → [Frontend Expert + SwiftUI Expert + Backend Specialist] → Integration
```
**Used for**: Independent feature development

### Pattern 3: Iterative Agent Refinement
```
Specialist Agent ↔ Code Quality Guardian ↔ Performance Engineer (until criteria met)
```
**Used for**: Quality optimization and performance tuning

---
