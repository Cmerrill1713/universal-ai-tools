echo "üì± ALEX ALTERNATIVE: AI-POWERED DEBUGGING"
echo "=========================================="
echo

echo "‚úÖ AVAILABLE TOOLS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ GitHub CLI (for potential Copilot)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Xcode built-in AI features"
echo "‚Ä¢ Custom debug logging (already added)"
echo "‚Ä¢ System health monitoring"
echo

echo "üöÄ DEBUGGING STRATEGY:"
echo "======================"
echo

echo "PHASE 1: Current Setup Test"
echo "---------------------------"
echo "1. Run Swift app from Xcode"
echo "2. Watch console for debug messages:"
echo "   üîß GroundingSystemManager initializing..."
echo "   üí¨ ChatViewSimple appeared"
echo "   üéØ Text field focus: true (when clicking)"
echo "   üî§ Text input changed: 'h' (when typing)"
echo

echo "PHASE 2: Enhanced Debugging (if needed)"
echo "---------------------------------------"
echo "1. Add more detailed print statements"
echo "2. Check Xcode Debug View Hierarchy"
echo "3. Test minimal text field implementation"
echo "4. Verify SwiftUI focus management"
echo

echo "PHASE 3: AI-Powered Analysis"
echo "----------------------------"
echo "1. Use Xcode's built-in code analysis"
echo "2. Copy problematic code for AI review"
echo "3. Try GitHub Copilot (if you want to set it up)"
echo "4. Use web-based AI for code review"
echo

echo "üîß IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:"
echo "====================="
echo

echo "1Ô∏è‚É£  Test Current Setup:"
echo "   cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "   Run app (Cmd+R) and test typing"
echo

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£  If Typing Still Doesn't Work:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check console for missing debug messages"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try clicking text field multiple times"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check if another app is stealing focus"
echo

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£  Enhanced Debugging (if needed):"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Add more print statements"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use Xcode Debug View Hierarchy"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Create minimal test case"
echo

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£  AI-Powered Analysis:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use Xcode Quick Help (Option+Click)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Copy code for AI review"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Try Fix-it suggestions (Cmd+1)"
echo

echo "üìä SUCCESS METRICS:"
echo "==================="
echo "‚úÖ App launches without crashes"
echo "‚úÖ Service status shows 'Connected'"
echo "‚úÖ Text field receives focus"
echo "‚úÖ Keyboard input is detected"
echo "‚úÖ Send button works"
echo

echo "üéØ Ready to start comprehensive debugging!"
echo "Follow the phases above and report results."
