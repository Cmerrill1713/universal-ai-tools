echo "🧪 Text Input Debug Test"
echo "========================"
echo

echo "🔧 CHANGES MADE:"
echo "================="
echo "• Created TextInputTest component for basic testing"
echo "• Temporarily replaced ChatViewSimple with TextInputTest"
echo "• Added aggressive focus management"
echo "• Fixed macOS compatibility issues"
echo

echo "🎯 TESTING STRATEGY:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. Test basic text input with minimal component"
echo "2. If basic input works, the issue is in ChatViewSimple"
echo "3. If basic input fails, the issue is system-wide"
echo

echo "🚀 HOW TO TEST:"
echo "==============="
echo "1. Launch app: cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "2. Run in Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "3. Click 'General Chat' button to open pop-out window"
echo "4. Try typing in the text field"
echo "5. Check console for debug messages"
echo

echo "📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "===================="
echo "• TextInputTest should appear in pop-out window"
echo "• Text field should show 'Type here to test...'"
echo "• Current text should update as you type"
echo "• Focus state should show 'Focused'"
echo "• Console should show: '🧪 Test text changed: [your text]'"
echo

echo "🔍 DEBUG MESSAGES TO WATCH FOR:"
echo "==============================="
echo "• 🧪 TextInputTest appeared"
echo "• 🧪 Auto-focused test text field"
echo "• 🧪 Test text changed: '[your text]'"
echo "• 🧪 Test focus changed: true"
echo

echo "❌ IF STILL NOT WORKING:"
echo "========================"
echo "• The issue is likely system-wide (macOS focus management)"
echo "• Try running from Xcode instead of command line"
echo "• Check if other apps can receive text input"
echo "• May need to restart macOS or check system permissions"
echo

echo "✅ IF WORKING:"
echo "=============="
echo "• The issue is in ChatViewSimple component"
echo "• We can fix it by applying the working patterns"
echo "• Basic text input is functional"
echo

echo "🎉 Ready to test the basic text input functionality!"
