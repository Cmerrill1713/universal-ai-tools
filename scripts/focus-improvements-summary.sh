echo "🎯 Focus Improvements Applied!"
echo "============================="
echo

echo "🔧 FOCUS ISSUES ADDRESSED:"
echo "=========================="
echo "• Initial focus state was false"
echo "• Text field wasn't getting focus immediately"
echo "• Need multiple focus attempts at different timings"
echo

echo "⚡ AGGRESSIVE FOCUS STRATEGY:"
echo "============================"
echo "• Immediate focus attempt on onAppear"
echo "• Focus retry at 0.1 seconds"
echo "• Focus retry at 0.5 seconds"
echo "• Focus retry at 1.0 seconds"
echo "• Window activation focus handling"
echo

echo "🎨 TEXT FIELD IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "==========================="
echo "• Changed to .plain text field style for better focus"
echo "• Added visible background with gray fill"
echo "• Dynamic border (blue when focused, gray when not)"
echo "• Better visual feedback for focus state"
echo

echo "🔍 DEBUG OUTPUT TO EXPECT:"
echo "========================="
echo "• 🎯 Initial focus state: false"
echo "• 🎯 Immediate focus attempt"
echo "• 🎯 Auto-focused text field (0.1s)"
echo "• 🎯 Text field focus: true"
echo "• 🎯 Auto-focused text field (0.5s)"
echo "• 🎯 Auto-focused text field (1.0s)"
echo

echo "🚀 TEST NOW:"
echo "============"
echo "1. Launch app: cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "2. Run in Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "3. Click 'General Chat' button"
echo "4. Watch for multiple focus attempts in console"
echo "5. Try typing - should work after focus is established"
echo

echo "💡 WHY MULTIPLE FOCUS ATTEMPTS:"
echo "=============================="
echo "• SwiftUI focus management can be timing-sensitive"
echo "• Window activation takes time"
echo "• Multiple attempts ensure focus is eventually achieved"
echo "• Different timings catch different window states"
echo

echo "🎉 The text field should now get focus and accept input!"
