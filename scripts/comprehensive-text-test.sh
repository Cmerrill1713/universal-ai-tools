echo "🧪 Comprehensive Text Input Test Suite"
echo "======================================"
echo

echo "🎯 TESTING STRATEGY:"
echo "===================="
echo "• Test multiple text input approaches"
echo "• Compare SwiftUI vs Native performance"
echo "• Identify which approach actually works"
echo

echo "🔧 TEST COMPONENTS CREATED:"
echo "==========================="
echo "1. SimpleTextTest - Multiple text field types in one view"
echo "2. NativeWindowChat - Pure NSWindow with NSTextField"
echo "3. Native Test button added to main UI"
echo

echo "🚀 HOW TO TEST:"
echo "==============="
echo "1. Launch app: cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "2. Run in Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "3. Click 'General Chat' button (SimpleTextTest)"
echo "4. Try typing in each text field type"
echo "5. Click 'Native Test' button (NativeWindowChat)"
echo "6. Try typing in the pure native window"
echo

echo "🔍 EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:"
echo "========================="
echo "SimpleTextTest (General Chat button):"
echo "• 🧪 SimpleTextTest appeared"
echo "• 🔤 SwiftUI text changed: '[your text]' (if SwiftUI works)"
echo "• 🔤 Native text changed: '[your text]' (if NSViewRepresentable works)"
echo "• 🔤 Direct NSTextField text changed: '[your text]' (if direct NSTextField works)"
echo
echo "NativeWindowChat (Native Test button):"
echo "• 🧪 Created native test window"
echo "• 🎯 Native window text field became first responder"
echo "• 🔤 Native window text field action: '[your text]' (if pure native works)"
echo

echo "📊 WHAT TO TEST:"
echo "================"
echo "• SwiftUI TextField - Does it receive text input?"
echo "• NSViewRepresentable NSTextField - Does it work?"
echo "• Direct NSTextField - Does it work?"
echo "• Pure NSWindow NSTextField - Does it work?"
echo

echo "💡 EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "===================="
echo "• SwiftUI TextField: Likely broken in pop-out windows"
echo "• NSViewRepresentable: Might work but focus issues"
echo "• Direct NSTextField: Should work better"
echo "• Pure NSWindow: Should definitely work"
echo

echo "🎉 This comprehensive test will identify which approach works!"
echo "Then we can implement the working solution in the actual chat interface."
