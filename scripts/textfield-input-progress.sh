echo "üéØ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Button Interaction Works!"
echo "================================================"
echo

echo "‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ User interaction is enabled"
echo "‚Ä¢ .allowsHitTesting(true) is working"
echo "‚Ä¢ Button clicks work properly"
echo "‚Ä¢ Focus management is functioning"
echo "‚Ä¢ The app can receive user input"
echo

echo "üéØ CURRENT ISSUE:"
echo "================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Button interaction works ‚úÖ"
echo "‚Ä¢ TextField input still not working ‚ùå"
echo "‚Ä¢ This narrows it down to TextField-specific issue"
echo

echo "üîß NEW APPROACH:"
echo "================"
echo "‚Ä¢ Testing 3 different TextField styles:"
echo "  1. Standard .roundedBorder style"
echo "  2. Plain style with custom background"
echo "  3. Another .roundedBorder style"
echo "‚Ä¢ All have .allowsHitTesting(true)"
echo "‚Ä¢ All have proper focus management"
echo

echo "üöÄ TEST INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. Run from Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "2. Try typing in each of the 3 TextFields"
echo "3. Tell me which one (if any) works"
echo "4. Use 'Set Text Programmatically' button to test"
echo

echo "üîç EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ At least one TextField should accept input"
echo "‚Ä¢ If none work, it's a deeper TextField issue"
echo "‚Ä¢ If one works, we can use that style"
echo

echo "üí° NEXT STEPS:"
echo "=============="
echo "‚Ä¢ If any TextField works ‚Üí use that style"
echo "‚Ä¢ If none work ‚Üí try NSViewRepresentable approach"
echo "‚Ä¢ If programmatic text works ‚Üí focus/input issue"
echo

echo "üéâ We're very close to solving this!"
