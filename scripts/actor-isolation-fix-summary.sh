echo "🎭 Actor Isolation Fix Complete!"
echo "==============================="
echo

echo "🔧 ACTOR ISSUES FIXED:"
echo "======================"
echo

echo "🎯 MAIN ACTOR ISOLATION:"
echo "• Added @MainActor to ChatViewSimple struct"
echo "• Added @MainActor to TextInputTest struct"
echo "• Ensured @FocusState is properly isolated to main actor"
echo

echo "⏰ ASYNC FOCUS MANAGEMENT:"
echo "• Replaced DispatchQueue.main.async with Task { @MainActor in }"
echo "• Used Task.sleep instead of DispatchQueue delays"
echo "• All focus operations now properly isolated"
echo

echo "🔄 FOCUS OPERATIONS FIXED:"
echo "• onAppear auto-focus now uses proper actor isolation"
echo "• onTapGesture focus management fixed"
echo "• NotificationCenter focus handlers fixed"
echo "• Window activation focus properly isolated"
echo

echo "🎨 WHY THIS MATTERS:"
echo "===================="
echo "• @FocusState must be managed on MainActor in SwiftUI"
echo "• Cross-actor access to UI state causes focus failures"
echo "• Proper isolation ensures text field receives focus"
echo "• Actor isolation prevents race conditions in focus management"
echo

echo "🚀 READY TO TEST:"
echo "================="
echo "1. Launch app: cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "2. Run in Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "3. Click 'General Chat' button"
echo "4. Try typing in the text field"
echo "5. Check console for focus debug messages"
echo

echo "🔍 EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:"
echo "========================="
echo "• 💬 ChatViewSimple appeared"
echo "• 🎯 Auto-focused text field"
echo "• 🔤 Text input changed: '[your text]'"
echo "• 🎯 Text field focus: true"
echo

echo "🎉 The actor isolation issue should now be resolved!"
echo "Text input should work properly with proper MainActor isolation."
