echo "================================="
echo

echo "üéØ RESEARCH FINDINGS:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Common issue: TextField not accepting keyboard input on macOS"
echo "‚Ä¢ Often caused by view hierarchy conflicts"
echo "‚Ä¢ State management issues with optional strings"
echo "‚Ä¢ Focus management problems"
echo "‚Ä¢ Modifier conflicts (offsets, backgrounds, etc.)"
echo

echo "üîß SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "========================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Explicitly non-optional String state"
echo "‚Ä¢ Proper @FocusState management"
echo "‚Ä¢ Auto-focus on view appear"
echo "‚Ä¢ Manual focus button for testing"
echo "‚Ä¢ Removed complex window styling"
echo "‚Ä¢ Fixed frame sizes for TextField"
echo "‚Ä¢ Clean view hierarchy without overlays"
echo

echo "‚úÖ KEY FIXES:"
echo "============="
echo "‚Ä¢ @State private var text: String = \"\" (non-optional)"
echo "‚Ä¢ @FocusState private var isTextFieldFocused: Bool"
echo "‚Ä¢ .focused(\$isTextFieldFocused) modifier"
echo "‚Ä¢ Auto-focus with DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter"
echo "‚Ä¢ Manual focus button for debugging"
echo "‚Ä¢ Removed .windowStyle(.hiddenTitleBar)"
echo

echo "üöÄ TEST INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. Open in Xcode: cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "2. Run from Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "3. Click in the text field"
echo "4. Try typing - should work now"
echo "5. Use 'Focus Field' button if needed"
echo

echo "üîç EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Text field should accept keyboard input"
echo "‚Ä¢ Text should appear in real-time"
echo "‚Ä¢ Focus should work properly"
echo "‚Ä¢ Clear button should work"
echo "‚Ä¢ Manual focus button should work"
echo

echo "üí° IF STILL NOT WORKING:"
echo "========================"
echo "‚Ä¢ Check macOS version compatibility"
echo "‚Ä¢ Try on physical device vs simulator"
echo "‚Ä¢ Check Xcode version (should be latest)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Verify no system-level keyboard issues"
echo

echo "üéâ This should fix the text input problem!"
echo "Based on common SwiftUI TextField issues on macOS."
