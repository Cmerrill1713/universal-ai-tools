echo

echo "üéØ CRITICAL TEST:"
echo "================="
echo "I've created a completely fresh Swift project to test if this is:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Project-specific issue (your project has problems)"
echo "‚Ä¢ System-wide issue (affects all SwiftUI apps)"
echo

echo "üöÄ TEST INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. Open the fresh project:"
echo "   cd TextInputTest && xed ."
echo
echo "2. Run it from Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo
echo "3. Try typing in the text field"
echo
echo "4. Tell me what happens:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Does it work? (text appears)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Does it beep? (system keyboard routing issue)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Does it do nothing? (focus issue)"
echo

echo "üîç DIAGNOSIS BASED ON RESULTS:"
echo "==============================="
echo

echo "IF FRESH PROJECT WORKS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Your original project has a configuration issue"
echo "‚Ä¢ We can fix it by copying the working structure"
echo "‚Ä¢ Problem is project-specific, not system-wide"
echo

echo "IF FRESH PROJECT ALSO FAILS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ This is a system-wide macOS/Xcode issue"
echo "‚Ä¢ Affects all SwiftUI TextField on your system"
echo "‚Ä¢ Need to investigate:"
echo "  - macOS version compatibility"
echo "  - Xcode version bugs"
echo "  - System-level keyboard issues"
echo "  - Hardware problems"
echo

echo "üí° NEXT STEPS:"
echo "=============="
echo "‚Ä¢ Test the fresh project first"
echo "‚Ä¢ Share the results"
echo "‚Ä¢ Based on results, we'll know if it's:"
echo "  - Project fixable (copy working structure)"
echo "  - System issue (need deeper investigation)"
echo

echo "üéØ This will definitively tell us what we're dealing with!"
