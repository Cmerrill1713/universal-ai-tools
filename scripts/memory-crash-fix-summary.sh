echo "üîß Memory Crash Fix Applied!"
echo "============================"
echo

echo "üéØ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "======================"
echo "‚Ä¢ objc_release crash in Objective-C runtime"
echo "‚Ä¢ Complex Timer management in GroundingSystemManager"
echo "‚Ä¢ Mixed Task and DispatchQueue usage causing retain cycles"
echo "‚Ä¢ @MainActor class with complex async operations"
echo "‚Ä¢ Memory corruption preventing ALL text input"
echo

echo "üîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "========================"
echo "‚Ä¢ Removed complex GroundingSystemManager"
echo "‚Ä¢ Created SimpleGroundingManager with minimal async operations"
echo "‚Ä¢ Disabled complex MonitoringDashboard temporarily"
echo "‚Ä¢ Simplified memory management throughout"
echo "‚Ä¢ Removed Timer-based periodic updates"
echo

echo "‚úÖ MEMORY IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "======================="
echo "‚Ä¢ No more Timer retain cycles"
echo "‚Ä¢ Simplified async operations"
echo "‚Ä¢ Removed complex @MainActor interactions"
echo "‚Ä¢ Clean memory management"
echo "‚Ä¢ No more objc_release crashes"
echo

echo "üé® SIMPLIFIED COMPONENTS:"
echo "========================="
echo "‚Ä¢ SimpleGroundingManager - Basic health checks only"
echo "‚Ä¢ SimpleChatView - Clean text input without complex focus"
echo "‚Ä¢ Disabled monitoring dashboard temporarily"
echo "‚Ä¢ Removed complex text field implementations"
echo

echo "üöÄ TEST THE FIX:"
echo "================"
echo "1. Launch app: cd UniversalAIToolsApp && xed ."
echo "2. Run in Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "3. Click 'General Chat' button"
echo "4. Try typing in the text field"
echo "5. Check for NO memory crashes"
echo

echo "üîç EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ No objc_release crashes"
echo "‚Ä¢ App runs stable"
echo "‚Ä¢ Text field should accept input"
echo "‚Ä¢ Simple, clean interface"
echo

echo "üí° WHY THIS SHOULD WORK:"
echo "========================"
echo "‚Ä¢ Removed all complex memory management"
echo "‚Ä¢ Eliminated Timer-based retain cycles"
echo "‚Ä¢ Simplified async operations"
echo "‚Ä¢ Clean SwiftUI text field implementation"
echo "‚Ä¢ No more memory corruption"
echo

echo "üéâ The memory crash should now be fixed!"
echo "Text input should work without crashes."
