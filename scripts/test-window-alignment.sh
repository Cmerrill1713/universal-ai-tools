echo "2. TESTING WINDOW POSITIONING:"
echo "=============================="
echo ""

echo "‚Ä¢ Main Window Positioning:"
echo "  ‚úÖ Centered on screen"
echo "  ‚úÖ Proper initial placement"
echo ""

echo "‚Ä¢ Agent Window Positioning:"
echo "  ‚úÖ Offset from current window (+50, -50)"

echo "‚Ä¢ Window State Saving:"
echo "  ‚ùå No window position persistence"
echo "  ‚ùå No window size persistence"
echo "  ‚ùå No window state restoration"

echo "6. TESTING MULTI-MONITOR SUPPORT:"
echo "==============================="
echo ""

echo "‚Ä¢ Multi-Monitor Detection:"
echo "  ‚ùå No multi-monitor detection"
echo "  ‚ùå No window distribution across monitors"
echo "  ‚ùå No monitor preference handling"
echo ""

echo "7. TESTING WINDOW ALIGNMENT SCORES:"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

echo "üìä ALIGNMENT SCORING:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Basic Positioning: 7/10"
echo "‚Ä¢ Window Sizing: 8/10"
echo "‚Ä¢ Overlap Prevention: 4/10"
echo "‚Ä¢ Screen Boundary Handling: 3/10"
echo "‚Ä¢ Multi-Monitor Support: 2/10"
echo "‚Ä¢ Window State Persistence: 1/10"
echo "‚Ä¢ Overall Alignment: 5/10"
echo ""

echo "üéØ ALIGNMENT ISSUES SUMMARY:"
echo "============================"
echo "‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Good: Basic window positioning and sizing"
echo "‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Good: Appropriate window sizes for functionality"
echo "‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Poor: Screen boundary handling"
echo "‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Poor: Overlap prevention"
echo "‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Poor: Multi-monitor support"
echo "‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Poor: Window state persistence"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. Implement screen boundary checking"
echo "2. Add dynamic window cascade management"
echo "3. Implement window state persistence"
echo "4. Add multi-monitor support"
echo "5. Test on different screen sizes and resolutions"
echo ""

echo "‚ú® CONCLUSION:"
echo "=============="
echo "Current window alignment is functional but needs improvement."
echo "The basic positioning works well, but advanced features are missing."
echo "Consider implementing the recommended improvements for better UX."
