```
### Known Patterns & Gotchas

```typescript

// CRITICAL: Universal AI Tools analytics patterns
// 1. MANDATORY: Analytics collection must not impact context injection performance

// Use async background processing for analytics

export class ContextAnalyticsService {

  async collectMetrics(contextData: ContextMetrics): Promise<void> {

    // Background processing - don't await

    this.processAnalyticsAsync(contextData);

  }

  

  private processAnalyticsAsync(data: ContextMetrics): void {

    // Async processing without blocking main context flow

    setImmediate(async () => {

      await this.storeAnalytics(data);

    });

  }

}
// 2. SECURITY: Multi-tenant analytics with RLS

// Use existing RLS patterns from supabase migrations

CREATE POLICY "Users can only view their own analytics" ON context_analytics

  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
// 3. PERFORMANCE: Efficient analytics queries with materialized views

// Create pre-computed aggregations for dashboard performance

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW context_effectiveness_hourly AS

SELECT 

  user_id,

  date_trunc('hour', created_at) as hour,

  avg(relevance_score) as avg_relevance,

  count(*) as total_queries

FROM context_analytics

GROUP BY user_id, date_trunc('hour', created_at);
// 4. INTEGRATION: Use existing monitoring patterns

// Extend system-status-dashboard.ts rather than creating isolated components

```
## Implementation Blueprint
### Data Models for Analytics Integration

Extend existing Supabase schema with analytics-specific tables that integrate with current context injection infrastructure.
```typescript

// Database schema extensions (supabase/migrations/004_context_analytics.sql)

interface ContextAnalyticsEntry {

  id: string;

  user_id: string;

  session_id: string;

  query_text: string; // Encrypted for privacy

  context_sources: string[];

  relevance_scores: number[];

  user_satisfaction?: number;

  response_quality?: number;

  processing_time_ms: number;

  created_at: timestamp;

}
// Service integration models

interface AnalyticsDashboardData {

  effectivenessMetrics: ContextEffectivenessMetrics;

  sourceQualityMatrix: SourceQualityData[];

  realtimeAlerts: AnalyticsAlert[];

  mlRecommendations: OptimizationRecommendation[];

}

```

### Per Task Pseudocode

```typescript

// Task 2: Analytics Collection Service

export class ContextAnalyticsService {

  private supabase;

  private analyticsQueue: ContextMetrics[] = [];

  

  constructor() {

    this.supabase = createClient(/* existing pattern */);

    this.startBatchProcessor(); // Background processing

  }

  

  // CRITICAL: Non-blocking analytics collection

  async collectContextMetrics(metrics: ContextMetrics): Promise<void> {

    // Add to queue - don't await processing

    this.analyticsQueue.push(metrics);

    

    // Immediate return - no performance impact on context injection

  }

  

  // PATTERN: Batch processing for efficiency

  private startBatchProcessor(): void {

    setInterval(async () => {

      if (this.analyticsQueue.length === 0) return;

      

      const batch = this.analyticsQueue.splice(0, 100); // Process in batches

      await this.processBatch(batch);

    }, 5000); // Every 5 seconds

  }

  

  // SECURITY: Multi-tenant analytics with RLS

  async getAnalyticsDashboard(userId: string): Promise<AnalyticsDashboardData> {

    const { data, error } = await this.supabase

      .rpc('get_context_analytics_dashboard', { 

        p_user_id: userId 

      }); // RLS enforced in function

      

    return data;

  }

}
// Task 3: Context Injection Integration

// MODIFY src/services/context-injection-service.ts

export class ContextInjectionService {

  async enrichWithContext(userRequest: string, projectContext: ProjectContext) {

    // ... existing implementation ...

    

    // INJECT: Analytics collection (async, non-blocking)

    const analyticsMetrics = {

      userId: projectContext.userId,

      sessionId: projectContext.sessionId,

      contextSources: sourcesUsed,

      relevanceScores: enrichedContext.relevantKnowledge.map(k => k.relevanceScore),

      processingTimeMs: Date.now() - startTime,

      totalContextTokens: enrichedContext.totalContextTokens

    };

    

    // CRITICAL: Don't await - background processing only

    contextAnalyticsService.collectContextMetrics(analyticsMetrics);

    

    return { enrichedPrompt, contextSummary, sourcesUsed };

  }

}

```

describe('ContextAnalyticsService', () => {

  test('collects metrics without blocking context injection', async () => {

    const startTime = Date.now();

    await contextAnalyticsService.collectContextMetrics(testMetrics);

    const endTime = Date.now();

    

    // Should complete in <10ms (non-blocking)

    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(10);

  });

  

  test('enforces multi-tenant data isolation', async () => {

    const user1Analytics = await contextAnalyticsService.getAnalyticsDashboard('user1');

    const user2Analytics = await contextAnalyticsService.getAnalyticsDashboard('user2');

    

    // Should not have access to other user's data

    expect(user1Analytics.some(a => a.user_id === 'user2')).toBeFalsy();

  });

  

  test('integrates with continuous learning service', async () => {

    // Test ML-driven recommendations generation

    const recommendations = await contextAnalyticsService.getOptimizationRecommendations('user1');

    expect(recommendations).toHaveLength(greaterThan(0));

  });

});

```
```bash

## Advanced Architecture Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Don't block context injection with analytics processing - use async background collection

- ❌ Don't create isolated analytics without integrating existing monitoring infrastructure

- ❌ Don't bypass RLS for analytics - maintain multi-tenant security

- ❌ Don't ignore performance requirements - dashboard must load <2s

- ❌ Don't duplicate ML infrastructure - leverage existing continuous learning service

- ❌ Don't skip materialized views for complex analytics queries

- ❌ Don't create separate authentication - use existing JWT and user management

- ❌ Don't ignore existing WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
