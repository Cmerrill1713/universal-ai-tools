echo "üéØ USER INTERACTION FIX APPLIED!"
echo "==============================="
echo

echo "‚úÖ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "======================"
echo "‚Ä¢ 'User Interaction Disabled' was the root cause"
echo "‚Ä¢ isUserInteractionEnabled was preventing input"
echo "‚Ä¢ This explains the beeping sounds (system receiving but app rejecting)"
echo "‚Ä¢ TextField was receiving focus but couldn't accept user input"
echo

echo "üîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "========================"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added .allowsHitTesting(true) to TextField"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added .allowsHitTesting(true) to container VStack"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added .allowsHitTesting(true) to entire ContentView"
echo "‚Ä¢ Added .allowsHitTesting(true) to all buttons"
echo "‚Ä¢ Ensured user interaction is enabled at every level"
echo

echo "‚úÖ KEY FIXES:"
echo "============="
echo "‚Ä¢ TextField: .allowsHitTesting(true)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Container: .allowsHitTesting(true)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Main View: .allowsHitTesting(true)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Buttons: .allowsHitTesting(true)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Proper focus management maintained"
echo

echo "üöÄ TEST THIS VERSION:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. Run from Xcode (Cmd+R)"
echo "2. Click in the text field"
echo "3. Type - should work now!"
echo "4. No more beeping sounds"
echo "5. Text should appear in real-time"
echo

echo "üîç EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ No beeping sounds when typing"
echo "‚Ä¢ Text field accepts keyboard input"
echo "‚Ä¢ Text appears in real-time"
echo "‚Ä¢ Focus management works properly"
echo "‚Ä¢ All buttons are clickable"
echo

echo "üí° WHY THIS FIXES IT:"
echo "===================="
echo "‚Ä¢ allowsHitTesting(true) enables user interaction"
echo "‚Ä¢ Without this, views can receive focus but not input"
echo "‚Ä¢ This is a common SwiftUI gotcha on macOS"
echo "‚Ä¢ The fix ensures the entire view hierarchy accepts input"
echo

echo "üéâ This should finally solve the text input problem!"
