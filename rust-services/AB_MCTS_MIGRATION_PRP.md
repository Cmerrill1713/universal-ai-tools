# AB-MCTS Service Rust Migration - Product Requirements Planning (PRP)

## Executive Summary

Migration of the AB-MCTS (Adaptive Bandit Monte Carlo Tree Search) service from TypeScript to Rust to achieve 3-5x performance improvement and 50-70% memory reduction for AI orchestration workloads.

## Business Justification

### Current Performance Issues
- **TypeScript bottlenecks**: Complex Monte Carlo simulations running at 1000+ iterations
- **Memory overhead**: JavaScript garbage collection causes 200ms+ pauses during search
- **Resource consumption**: Current implementation uses 500MB+ during complex orchestrations
- **Scaling limitations**: Cannot handle 10+ parallel orchestrations efficiently

### Expected Business Impact
- **3-5x faster orchestration**: Reduce average orchestration time from 5s to 1-2s
- **70% memory reduction**: Lower memory footprint from 500MB to 150MB
- **Higher throughput**: Support 50+ concurrent orchestrations vs current 10
- **Cost savings**: Reduced cloud compute costs for AI workloads

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core AB-MCTS Algorithm
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Selection, expansion, simulation, backpropagation phases
- **Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian bandit algorithm for exploration/exploitation
- **UCB1 Selection**: Upper Confidence Bound action selection
- **Beta Distribution Sampling**: Statistical sampling for reward modeling

#### Search Configuration
- **Max iterations**: 1000 (configurable)
- **Max depth**: 10 levels
- **Exploration constant**: √2 (configurable)
- **Time limits**: 30-second maximum search time
- **Discount factor**: 0.95 for future rewards

#### Agent Management
- **Dynamic agent selection** from available pool
- **Agent performance tracking** with Bayesian models
- **Capability matching** for context requirements
- **Performance score calculation** with confidence intervals

#### Learning & Adaptation
- **Feedback processing** for continuous improvement
- **Reward calculation** (quality + speed + cost components)
- **Historical performance** tracking per agent
- **Bayesian model updates** based on execution results

### Performance Requirements
- **Search latency**: <2 seconds for 1000 iterations
- **Memory usage**: <150MB peak during search
- **Concurrent searches**: 50+ parallel without degradation
- **CPU utilization**: <80% single core during search

### Integration Requirements
- **TypeScript API compatibility**: Maintain existing interfaces
- **Async execution**: Non-blocking operation with futures
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error propagation
- **Logging integration**: Compatible with existing logger
- **Caching support**: Redis-based tree persistence

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability
- **99.9% availability** for search operations
- **Graceful degradation** when memory constrained
- **Circuit breaker** integration for failure handling
- **Backup strategies** for critical search states

### Security
- **Input validation** for all agent contexts
- **Memory safety** with Rust ownership model
- **No secret leakage** in logs or error messages
- **Secure inter-process** communication

### Maintainability
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation
- **Comprehensive testing** (unit + integration)
- **Documentation** for all public APIs
- **Performance monitoring** hooks

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- ✅ **Search time**: <2s for 1000 iterations (baseline: 5s)
- ✅ **Memory usage**: <150MB peak (baseline: 500MB)
- ✅ **Throughput**: 50+ concurrent searches (baseline: 10)
- ✅ **CPU efficiency**: >3x ops/cpu-second vs TypeScript

### Quality Metrics
- ✅ **API compatibility**: 100% existing interface support
- ✅ **Test coverage**: >95% code coverage
- ✅ **Error rate**: <0.1% search failures
- ✅ **Integration**: Zero-downtime deployment

### Business Metrics
- ✅ **Cost reduction**: 40%+ lower compute costs
- ✅ **User experience**: Sub-2s orchestration response
- ✅ **Scalability**: Handle 10x current load
- ✅ **Reliability**: <1 minute downtime during deployment

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Complex algorithm migration**: Monte Carlo tree search complexity
- **Statistical correctness**: Thompson sampling mathematical precision
- **Performance regression**: Ensuring Rust benefits are realized
- **Integration complexity**: TypeScript ↔ Rust communication overhead

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental validation**: Test each algorithm component separately
- **Statistical validation**: Compare distributions with TypeScript version
- **Benchmarking suite**: Continuous performance monitoring
- **Gradual rollout**: Feature flags for safe deployment

### Contingency Plans
- **Rollback capability**: Keep TypeScript version as fallback
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time alerts for degradation
- **Load balancing**: Route traffic based on service health
- **Emergency procedures**: Documented incident response

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- **Rust ecosystem**: tokio, serde, nalgebra, rand
- **Redis integration**: Connection pooling for tree storage
- **TypeScript bridge**: Node.js native modules or FFI
- **Existing infrastructure**: Logger, metrics, error handling

### Resource Constraints
- **Development time**: 6-8 weeks for core implementation
- **Testing requirements**: 2 weeks for comprehensive validation
- **Integration effort**: 1 week for TypeScript bridge
- **Documentation**: 1 week for technical documentation

### Deployment Constraints
- **Zero downtime**: Deployment without service interruption
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts
- **Performance validation**: Pre-production performance testing
- **Monitoring setup**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting
