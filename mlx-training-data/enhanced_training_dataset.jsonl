{"prompt": "Instruction: What is monitoring setup?\nResponse:", "completion": "SSL certificates are automatically managed through Let's Encrypt with automated renewal"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: What are the key performance improvements achieved in the hybrid architecture?\nResponse:", "completion": "The hybrid architecture achieved significant performance improvements: 60% memory usage reduction (2.5GB to <1GB), 61% faster response times (223ms to 87ms), 10x improvement in concurrent connections (1,000 to 10,000+), and 5x throughput improvement (500 to 2,500+ req/sec). The migration consolidated 68 routers into 3 core services (95% consolidation)."}
{"prompt": "Instruction: How does the auto-healing system work?\nResponse:", "completion": "The system includes comprehensive test suites covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: What are the modern SwiftUI architecture patterns for macOS 15?\nResponse:", "completion": "Modern SwiftUI for macOS 15 uses @Observable macro instead of ObservableObject, eliminates ViewModels in favor of @Observable business logic classes, uses @Environment for dependency injection, employs NavigationSplitView for native macOS navigation, and applies @MainActor isolation for thread safety. The pattern separates UI from business logic while maintaining reactivity."}
{"prompt": "Instruction: How is secure storage implemented in the Swift macOS app?\nResponse:", "completion": "The app migrated completely from UserDefaults to Keychain storage using KeychainService.swift for all sensitive data including API keys, user credentials, and tokens. It includes hardware-based authentication via Bluetooth with RSSI proximity detection, family device management with roles, and automatic token expiry management."}
{"prompt": "Instruction: What is memory optimization?\nResponse:", "completion": "Services communicate through event-driven messaging patterns with automatic failure recovery"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: How does backup procedures improve system performance?\nResponse:", "completion": "Blue-green deployment strategy ensures zero-downtime updates with automatic rollback capabilities"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: What are common Swift concurrency errors and their solutions?\nResponse:", "completion": "Common Swift 6.0 concurrency errors include 'Sending actor-isolated non-sendable' (solution: mark types as Sendable or use @MainActor), 'Data race accessing from different actor' (solution: proper actor isolation), 'Cannot convert sendable requirement' (solution: Sendable protocol conformance), and 'async function not supported' (solution: mark function as async or use Task blocks)."}
{"prompt": "Instruction: How do you debug production issues in the hybrid architecture?\nResponse:", "completion": "Debug production issues by checking service health endpoints (/health on each port), reviewing logs in /tmp/ directories, using circuit breaker status endpoints, monitoring Prometheus metrics on port 9090, checking auto-healing logs in /tmp/uat-autoheal/, and using distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for request flow analysis."}
{"prompt": "Instruction: What safety measures should be implemented for MLX fine-tuning?\nResponse:", "completion": "MLX fine-tuning safety includes regression testing against baseline models, confidence thresholds for automated actions, anti-hallucination measures through validation datasets, performance benchmarking before deployment, gradual rollout with rollback capabilities, and automated quality checks. Fine-tuning frequency should be limited to prevent overfitting and maintain stability."}
{"prompt": "Instruction: When should you use speech synthesis?\nResponse:", "completion": "Fine-tuning uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient model customization on domain data"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: How do you debug a Rust service that won't start?\nInput: The LLM Router service on port 8082 is failing to start with 'address already in use' error\nResponse:", "completion": "Rust services are built with 'cargo build --release' for optimal performance and memory safety"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: When should you use docker containerization?\nResponse:", "completion": "Comprehensive health monitoring includes service discovery and automatic recovery mechanisms"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: Explain the voice recognition implementation\nResponse:", "completion": "The entire system operates fully offline for maximum privacy and security"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: Explain the containerization implementation\nResponse:", "completion": "Swift provides native macOS and iOS client applications with SwiftUI for modern user interfaces"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: How does go build work in Universal AI Tools?\nResponse:", "completion": "Start development with 'npm run dev:local' to launch the Go API gateway on port 8082"}
{"prompt": "Instruction: When should you use distributed system?\nResponse:", "completion": "The system implements distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for comprehensive monitoring across all services"}
