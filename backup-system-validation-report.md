## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **Timestamp Handling Bug**
   - Impact: Backup verification and cleanup operations fail
   - Root Cause: `metadata.timestamp.toISOString is not a function`
   - Location: Database returns string timestamps, code expects Date objects
   - Priority: HIGH - Fix required for production use

### Minor Issues
2. **Schema Cache Inconsistency**
   - Impact: Required column name adjustments during setup
   - Root Cause: Camel case vs. snake_case column naming
   - Resolution: Applied during testing
   - Priority: MEDIUM - Consider standardizing naming convention

3. **Missing Test Tables**
   - Impact: Initial backup attempts failed with missing tables
   - Root Cause: Default configuration references non-existent tables
   - Resolution: Used existing simple_test table
   - Priority: LOW - Improve default configuration

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Backup Creation Time | 46-47ms | <120s | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| Backup Size (3 records) | 557-564 B | N/A | ‚úÖ EFFICIENT |
| Compression Ratio | ~50% | >30% | ‚úÖ GOOD |
| Storage Success Rate | 100% | 95% | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
