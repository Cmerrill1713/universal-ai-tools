# Task Context: Migrating and Enhancing `alert-notification-service`

---

## 1. ðŸ“š Task Definition

### **Problem Statement / Goal:**
The goal is to refactor the existing `alert-notification-service` written in TypeScript to a Go implementation while ensuring backward compatibility with the current API, which is exposed via HTTP endpoints. The new implementation should also include additional logging and improved error handling.

### **Scope:**
- **In Scope:**
  - Refactor the `alert-notification-service` from TypeScript to Go.
  - Ensure that existing external integrations (e.g., email sending) continue to function as before.
  - Add structured logging using Zap in the new implementation.
  - Improve error handling by implementing a unified error response structure.

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Migrating other services or components.
  - Updating existing UI or frontend code that consumes this service.
  - Replacing or refactoring external integrations (e.g., email service).

---

## 2. ðŸ§  Design and Implementation

### **Design Overview:**
- The new Go implementation will maintain the same public API as the TypeScript version to ensure compatibility with downstream consumers.
- New features like structured logging and improved error handling will be added in the Go code.

### **Implementation Plan:**

1. **Define the API contract using OpenAPI:**
   - Create an `alert_service.yaml` file that defines the API endpoints, request/response schemas, and other details.
   
2. **Implement the service in Go:**
   - Set up a basic Go HTTP server with routing using `chi`.
   - Implement the `SendAlert` endpoint according to the OpenAPI spec.

3. **Generate TypeScript client code:**
   - Use `openapi-generator-cli` to generate a TypeScript client from the `alert_service.yaml` file.
   
4. **Integrate the new Go service into the existing orchestrator:**
   - Replace the old TypeScript implementation with the new Go service in the orchestrator (e.g., Express app).
   
5. **Add structured logging and error handling:**
   - Use Zap for logging in the Go service.
   - Implement a unified `Error` response struct that conforms to the HTTP status codes.

### **Technology Choices:**
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** 
  - Go standard library (net/http, chi)
  - OpenAPI Generator (`openapi-generator-cli`)
  - Zap for logging

**Files Expected to be Changed:**

1. `alert_service.yaml` - Define API contract.
2. `alert_server.go` - Implement the Go service with routing and endpoint logic.
3. `main.go` - Entry point of the Go application, integrate the new service into the existing orchestrator.
4. `error_response.go` - Define unified error response structure.

### **Examples:**

1. **Defining the API Contract (`alert_service.yaml`):**
   ```yaml
   openapi: 3.0.2
   info:
     title: Alert Service API
     version: 1.0.0
   paths:
     /alerts:
       post:
         summary: Send an alert
         requestBody:
           required: true
           content:
             application/json:
               schema:
                 $ref: '#/components/schemas/Alert'
         responses:
           '200':
             description: Alert sent successfully
             content:
               application/json:
                 schema:
                   $ref: '#/components/schemas/AlertResponse'
   components:
     schemas:
       Alert:
         type: object
         properties:
           id:
             type: string
           message:
             type: string
       AlertResponse:
         type: object
         properties:
           status:
             type: integer
           message:
             type: string
   ```

2. **Implementing the Go Service (`alert_server.go`):**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
     "net/http"
     "log"
     "github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
     "github.com/pkg/errors"
     "example.com/alert_service/error_response"
   )

   func sendAlertHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
     alert := new(alert_service.Alert)
     if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&alert); err != nil {
       log.Printf("Error decoding request body: %s", err)
       respondWithError(w, http.StatusBadRequest, "invalid request payload")
       return
     }

     // Process the alert (e.g., send email)
     processAlert(alert)

     respondWithJSON(w, http.StatusOK, &error_response.AlertResponse{
       Status: 200,
       Message: "Alert sent successfully",
     })
   }

   func main() {
     router := chi.NewRouter()
     router.Post("/alerts", sendAlertHandler)

     log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router))
   }
   ```

3. **Generating TypeScript Client (`alert_service.yaml` to `client.ts`):**
   ```sh
   npx openapi-generator-cli generate -i alert_service.yaml -g typescript-axios -o ./generated-client
   ```

---

## 3. ðŸ§ª Testing

### **Automated Testing (by Coder):**

**Automated Test Strategy:**
- Write unit tests for the Go implementation to cover all endpoints and error handling.
- Write integration tests to ensure that the Go service works correctly with existing external integrations.

**Test Cases Implemented:**
1. Unit test 1 - Verify `sendAlertHandler` processes a valid alert request.
2. Integration test 1 - Ensure the email is sent successfully when an alert is processed.
3. E2E test 1 - Test end-to-end flow from sending an alert to receiving it and logging.

**Test Coverage Targets:**
- Minimum 80% code coverage for Go implementation.
- All workflows tested, including edge cases (e.g., invalid input).

### **Manual Testing (by Tester):**

**Manual Testing Strategy:**
- Verify that the new service behaves as expected under normal and error conditions.
- Test logging and error responses.

**Test Setup Instructions:**
1. Start the Go service on port 8080.
2. Set up an email sending service for testing.

**Test Cases / Test Steps:**
1. Send a valid alert request and verify the response status code and message.
2. Send an invalid alert request and ensure the appropriate error is logged and returned.
3. Send multiple alerts to test batch processing capabilities (if any).

**Expected Results:**
- Valid requests should return 200 with correct JSON responses.
- Invalid requests should return appropriate HTTP status codes and errors.
- Logs should contain detailed information about successful and failed operations.

**Known Risks / Focus Areas:**
- Potential issues in error handling during alert processing.
- Logging should be comprehensive enough to debug any issues.
