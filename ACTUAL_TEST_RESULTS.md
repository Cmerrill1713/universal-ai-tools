# üß™ NeuroForge AI - Actual Test Results (Playwright)

**Tested:** October 11, 2025  
**Method:** Live testing through frontend using Playwright

---

## ‚úÖ WORKING FUNCTIONS

| Test | Request | Result | Status |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Browser** | "Search Google for Mars" | Browser window opened to Google | ‚úÖ **PASS** |
| **Math** | "What's 456 times 789?" | Calculated: 359,804 | ‚úÖ **PASS** |
| **General Chat** | Regular questions | AI responds intelligently | ‚úÖ **PASS** |

---

## ‚ùå NOT WORKING / NEED WIRING

| Test | Request | Result | Issue |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| **macOS Control** | "Open Calculator app" | Instructions instead of opening | ‚ùå Tool not called |
| **Research Tasks** | "Research Python frameworks" | Error | ‚ùå Orchestrator issue |

---

## üîç DIAGNOSIS

### What's Working:
1. ‚úÖ **Browser automation** - Keyword detection works, opens real windows
2. ‚úÖ **Math/calculations** - LLM handles directly  
3. ‚úÖ **General chat** - Base LLM functionality
4. ‚úÖ **Infrastructure** - All backends running, agents available

### What Needs Connection:
1. ‚ùå **macOS automation** - Tool exists but not called by chat
2. ‚ùå **Research routing** - Orchestrator errors out
3. ‚ùì **GitHub tools** - Need to test
4. ‚ùì **Puzzle solving** - Need to test
5. ‚ùì **Multi-agent tasks** - Need to test

## üí° THE ISSUE

You have **40 API endpoints** and **19 agents** available, but the **chat endpoint doesn't know how to call them!**

**Current State:**
- Browser automation: ‚úÖ Hardcoded keyword detection (I just added this)
- Everything else: ‚ùå LLM doesn't have tool calling configured

**What's Needed:**
The chat needs **function/tool calling** configured so the LLM can:
1. Detect when to use tools
2. Call the right API endpoint
3. Parse the result
4. Respond to the user

---

## üéØ SOLUTION

Configure the chat to use **OpenAI function calling** format with ALL your tools:

```python
tools = [
    {"name": "open_macos_app", "endpoint": "/api/automation/macos/execute"},
    {"name": "browse_web", "endpoint": "/api/automation/browser/execute"},  # Already works!
    {"name": "github_search", "endpoint": "/api/github/..."},
    {"name": "solve_puzzle", "endpoint": "/api/orchestration/solve-grid"},
    {"name": "research_topic", "endpoint": "/api/orchestration/execute"},
    # ... all 40 endpoints as tools
]
```

Then wire them into the LLM call so it can choose which tool to use for each request.

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. Map all 40 endpoints as callable tools
2. Configure LLM with function calling
3. Add tool call detection & execution
4. Test all capabilities end-to-end

**OR** - Use your existing MCP integration (Playwright, GitHub, etc.) and wire it into the chat endpoint!
