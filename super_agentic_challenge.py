You are tasked with creating a system that can improve itself. Here's the challenge:

1. Analyze your current capabilities and identify 3 key weaknesses
2. For each weakness, propose a specific improvement strategy
3. Design a feedback loop that would allow you to measure the effectiveness of these improvements
4. Create a plan for implementing these improvements autonomously
5. Consider how this system would evolve over time - what would it look like after 10 iterations?

Be specific, actionable, and demonstrate deep thinking about the nature of self-improvement.
